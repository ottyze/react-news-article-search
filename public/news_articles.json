October 27, 2020.\n\nAditya Puri is due to retire as Managing Director of the bank on October 26.\n\n\"CEO succession uncertainty finally ended, which is positive for the bank. Sashi has been closely connected with internal\/board & external stakeholders. His appointment should make the transition at the bank smoother,\" said Citi while having a buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 1,350 per share, implying 30 percent potential upside from current levels.\n\nSashidhar Jagdishan has been working in HDFC Bank since 1996 when he was appointed as a Manager in the finance function.\n\nSashi is currently the Group Head of Finance, Human Resources, Legal & Secretarial, Administration, Infrastructure, Corporate Communications, Corporate Social Responsibility & the Strategic Change Agent of the bank.\n\n\"Sashi Jagdishan is the right choice and a big positive. He ensures continuity. He is 'hard task master & investors' choice too,\" said Macquarie while retaining outperform call on the stock with a target of Rs 1,114 per share, implying 7 percent potential upside.\n\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\n\nHDFC Bank's stock price has been under pressure due to concerns around the succession and the recent attrition in the top management. The stake sale by Aditya Puri had also impacted the sentiment and raised uncertainty over the CEO finalisation. The stock had corrected 12 percent in two weeks before the finalisation of CEO by RBI\n\n\"Although some concerns remain around top-level attrition, the RBI's approval addresses a major overhang on the stock's performance as Mr Jagdishan has been with the bank for the past several years; thus, succession by an internal candidate augurs well to boost investor confidence and continue the impeccable performance the bank has witnessed under the leadership of Mr Puri,\" said Motilal Oswal.\n\nWith the system challenged by the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, the brokerage believes large banks are relatively better placed to tide over this crisis. Thus, it remained positive on HDFC Bank and maintained buy call with a target of Rs 1,280, implying 23 percent potential upside.\n\nDisclaimer: The above report is compiled from information available on public platforms.

Yet GlobalData shows that new IT contracts are shrinking worldwide \u2014 both by value and volume.From $14.4 billion of global IT services spending at the end of June last year, this year companies only doled out $4 billion. Only 7% of the contracts signed in the last three months were valued above $100 million.However Indian IT firms are witnessing a different trend, with deal win numbers that are better than what they were in 2019. And, the management commentary paints a very different picture of new deal wins improving in the coming quarters.Analysts believe that the crunch in IT spending is due to pricing pressures. Most businesses are looking to conserve cash in the face of uncertainty.Indian IT companies \u2014 like(TCS), Wipro, Infosys,and Tech Mahindra \u2014 believe that even though there was disruption, the current demand is driven by digital transformation. More businesses are looking to work from home bringing cloud adoption, automation, cybersecurity and consolidation to the forefront.The biggest IT company in India, TCS, saw a 22.5% dip in the value of new deal wins at the end of June as compared to three months ago, but when compared to the previous year \u2014 the value of its new deal wins was actually up by 21% at $6.9 billion.\u201cOverall, from a first-quarter order book perspective, contrary to the fears of economic uncertainty and travel restrictions, etc., deal closures have continued at pace,\u201d said TCS CEO Rajesh Gopinathan during the earnings call.The other Indian IT services behemoth, Infosys, did see the value of its new deal wins come down by 35.5% year-on-year (YoY). However, the company already has the largest deal win in its history in the bag for a whopping $1.5 billion with Vanguard, which will be counted towards next quarter\u2019s deal wins.\u201cAs the challenges persist, we see clients looking for opportunities to improve the efficiency of their tech spend and we continue to see a robust pipeline of deals in this segment,\u201d said Infosys\u2019 COO Pravin Rao.HCL Technologies did not disclose the value of its deal wins but did say that it signed 11 new contracts \u2014 three less than last quarter and just one deal short of the same time last year.\u201cLooking ahead, I see very good growth in the pipeline. In the last quarter to this quarter, our pipeline increased by 40%,\u201d saidCEO C Vijayakumar.All in all, the consensus by Indian IT services companies\u2019 is that new deal wins are only set to grow in the coming quarters. The one concern they do have is that the closure of deals is taking longer than usual due to the current circumstances."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.tribuneindia.com\/news\/nation\/lufthansa-to-commence-flight-services-to-delhi-mumbai-bengaluru-from-august-13-124699","domain":"tribuneindia.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 12:23:00","title":"Lufthansa to commence flight services to Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru from August 13","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.tribuneindia.com\/sortd-service\/assets\/v22-12\/dGhldHJpYnVuZS1zb3J0ZC1wcm8tcHJvZC1zb3J0ZC9oZWFkZXJfYnJhbmRpbmc6YnJhbmRfbG9nbzJmZDYwZGQwLTRkMjktMTFlZi04ZjQ0LTdmY2NhYjRhM2Y4Nw==","content":"Mumbai, August 10\n\nGerman carrier Lufthansa on Monday announced the commencement of its flight services to Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru from Frankfurt from August 13, under a \u201cbilateral agreement\u201d between the governments.\n\nThe company will also run flight services on the Munich-Delhi route.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe European carrier is already operating flights out of India to its two hubs\u2014Frankfurt and Munich\u2014for the past several months, according to a release.\n\n\u201cFollowing a bilateral agreement between India and Germany, inbound passenger flights to India will be reinstated from August 13,\u201d Lufthansa said in the release.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the operations of flights from Germany into India, Lufthansa will be able to help people return to India and enable business travel as the world gradually begins to open up, said George Ettiyil, Lufthansa Group\u2019s senior director for South Asia sales.\n\nScheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since late March due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, various evacuation and chartered flights are being currently operated to fly back stranded Indians in various countries and also transport foreign nationals, who are stuck in India, to their countries.\n\nLufthansa in the release said since July it has made available PCR coronavirus test facility to the Indian customers at Frankfurt and Munich airports.\n\n\u201cBoth coronavirus test centres at our hubs in Frankfurt and Munich provide customers the opportunity to avoid being quarantined when arriving in Germany, with a negative coronavirus test in their hand,\u201d said Ettiyil.\n\nIndia had last month announced the establishment of individual bilateral bubbles with France and the US that will allow airlines of each country in the pact to operate international flights and had said a similar arrangement with Germany and the UK was also in the offing.\n\nAn air travel bubble is a bilateral arrangement with a set of regulations and restrictions in which the airlines of the two countries can operate international flights. \u2014 PTI"},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.businesslive.co.za\/bd\/national\/2020-08-05-saa-stalls-again-as-rescue-practitioners-wait-for-new-funding\/","domain":"businesslive.co.za","published_date":"2020-08-05 12:17:00","title":"SAA stalls again as rescue practitioners wait for new funding","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.businesslive.co.za\/static\/icons\/patners\/nedbank-cib.png","content":"When people back home ask me how living in New York is, I know the answer they are looking for must align with that Alicia Keys and Jay Z song"},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/world\/us\/us-to-pay-over-1-billion-for-100-million-doses-of-jjs-potential-covid-19-vaccine\/articleshow\/77374306.cms","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 13:20:00","title":"US to pay over $1 billion for 100 million doses of J&J's potential Covid-19 vaccine","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.toiimg.com\/thumb\/msid-77374288,imgsize-136798,width-400,resizemode-4\/77374288.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON : The United States government will pay Johnson & Johnson over $1 billion for 100 million doses of its investigational coronavirus vaccine , the drugmaker said on Wednesday.It said it will deliver the vaccine to Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) on a not-for-profit basis to be used after approval or emergency use authorization by the U.S.Food and Drug Administration (FDA).J&J's investigational vaccine is currently being tested on healthy volunteers in the United States and Belgium in an early stage study."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.theedgemarkets.com\/article\/can-top-glove-surpass-market-cap-aseans-largest-bank","domain":"theedgemarkets.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 09:00:00","title":"Can Top Glove surpass market cap of Asean's largest bank?","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.theedgemarkets.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.theedgemarkets.com%2FTOPGlove1_TEM1329_20200728131504_theedgemarkets.jpg&w=1920&q=75","content":"This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly on July 27, 2020 - August 2, 2020\n\nWILL Top Glove Corp Bhd, whose share price has risen 440% year to date, see its market capitalisation (cap) surpass that of Southeast Asia\u2019s largest bank \u2014 DBS Group Ltd?\n\nWell, some glove bulls think that is a possible scenario.\n\nOf the most optimistic glove bulls, Affin Hwang Capital Research analyst Ng Chi Hoong pondered, in a note earlier last week, the possibility of Top Glove\u2019s share price breaching RM100 should investors ascribe a higher valuation on the world\u2019s largest glove maker.\n\nPegging a price-to-earnings ratio (PER) of 52 times, which Ng noted is similar to Hartalega Holdings Bhd\u2019s valuation, he said, \u201cOur bull-case scenario indicates that Top Glove\u2019s fair value could be as high as RM110.20, if selling prices do increase by 10% (month-on-month) each month in FY2021E.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, if Top Glove were to trade to RM110 apiece, this would mean its market cap could reach a whopping RM295 billion, surpassing that of even DBS Group, which had a market cap of S$52.4 billion (RM161 billion) as at last Friday.\n\nSo far, no Malaysian-listed company has managed to breach the RM150 billion mark.\n\nIn a research note published last Tuesday, Ng raised his target price for Top Glove from RM22.40 to RM46.40, hinging on a PER of 30 times ascribed on his forecast earnings.\n\nNotably, if Top Glove shares reach RM46.40 apiece, this would mean that its market cap will reach RM125 billion, surpassing that of Malaysia\u2019s largest listed company Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) by a comfortable 40% margin.\n\nNg\u2019s optimism is premised on a high possibility that Top Glove\u2019s average selling price (ASP) could be higher than his base case of 5% m-o-m increment, given the strong surge in demand for gloves.\n\n\u201cIf selling prices were to increase by 8% to 10% m-o-m each month in FY2021E, our earnings forecasts would be lifted between 24% and 42%,\u201d he said, adding that Top Glove could see direct earnings improvement, owing to operating leverage, as cost does not increase in tandem with an increase in ASP.\n\nIn terms of the potential effect from the US Customs and Border Protection\u2019s detention order on disposable gloves produced by two of Top Glove\u2019s subsidiaries, Ng thinks the impact on the group\u2019s earnings is manageable at 5% to 6%.\n\nHe also believes that, should there be any unfavourable circumstances, Top Glove could reroute its orders for the US to other countries at spot prices, which could give the glove maker better margins, as spot prices are generally higher by about 5%.\n\nQuantum leap in market cap rankings\n\nAt last Friday\u2019s market close, Top Glove was valued at RM68.62 billion, making it the third-largest listed company in the country, behind Public Bank Bhd\u2019s RM68.79 billion.\n\nJust the previous day, Top Glove had edged out Public Bank by a margin of nearly RM1 billion.\n\nSo far this year, Top Glove\u2019s ranking by market cap has jumped 31 places, from 34th to third-largest in Malaysia.\n\nA similar scenario has unfolded in Singapore, where Top Glove is also listed. Top Glove Singapore is now the 10th-largest company on the Singapore Exchange, with a market cap of S$22.66 billion. So far this year, it has skipped past 41 companies, from 51st position at the start of 2020.\n\nNotably, Top Glove is also among the stocks listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Emerging Markets Index (DJSI) in September 2019 in recognition of its sustainability practices.\n\nTop Glove is ranked 15th out of 44 healthcare companies, placing it among the top 33% performers across all DJSI indices.\n\nSave by subscribing to us for your print and\/or digital copy."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.hulldailymail.co.uk\/whats-on\/food-drink\/kfc-customer-outraged-after-having-4407821","domain":"hulldailymail.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-08 14:18:00","title":"KFC customer outraged after having to pay full price for her meal due to Eat Out to Help Out scheme 'loophole'","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/v2\/media\/MvYqfvAc\/poster.jpg","content":"Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nSign up to our free email alerts for the top Hull Foodies stories sent straight to your e-mail\n\nSomething went wrong, please try again later.\n\nSign up to our free email alerts for the top Hull Foodies stories sent straight to your e-mail\n\nA KFC customer was left livid after a Eat Out To Help Out 'loophole' resulted in her paying full price for her food.\n\nThe mum from Kent hit out at the fried chicken giant after trying to use the new government scheme - the same day it came into effect (August 3) - at her local KFC in Tunbridge Wells.\n\nThe Eat Out To Help Out scheme was announced by the government back in July, running from August 3-31, and was designed to encourage Brits to eat out again after lockdown.\n\nThe scheme allows customers to get up to 50 per cent off their order at restaurants that have signed up to it.\n\nThe mum, from Tonbridge, who asked not to be named, says she made the trip to Tunbridge Wells on Monday lunchtime (August 3) in hope of supporting the business, Kent Live reports.\n\nShe said: \u201cI was looking at the Government website the day before to see all the local places that were participating, and I wrote a list of where we could visit to make use of the scheme and to support the businesses.\"\n\nThe official KFC website, along with the Government\u2019s website, had listed the Fountains Retail Park branch as being part of the scheme, but it was initially removed.\n\nShe continued: \"We walked in and noticed the self-service machines were all switched off.\n\n\"Everyone was told to pay at the till, whereas last week use of the self-service machines was being encouraged.\"\n\nA manager at the Tunbridge Wells branch reportedly told her they had received an email that morning explaining that they will not be offering the discount.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon 8 Cancel Play now\n\nPosters advertising the scheme were taken down as a result, and machines that were pre-programmed to apply the discount were switched off.\n\nThe customer raged: \"The signs have been up to say that they were going to participate, everything said that they were.\n\n\"There was nothing inside to say that they would no longer apply the scheme until after you pay and realise.\n\n\"We spoke to other customers inside who were also expecting the scheme to be applied, and I saw lots of comments on Twitter also saying the same thing.\"\n\nThe fast food chain has since confirmed it is now offering discounts in line with the scheme.\n\nA KFC spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019re offering guests 50% discount across the board, up to \u00a310 per person with no minimum spend.\n\n\"As per the Government intentions for the scheme, it\u2019s available on food ordered to eat in on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesdays throughout August.\n\n\"We currently have 580 restaurants participating, which you can find on our website.\n\n\"For those worrying they\u2019ll miss out, we\u2019re also adding even more over the next couple of days to bring this up to around 700 of our restaurants.\""},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.carandbike.com\/news\/yamaha-launches-online-sales-in-india-through-new-website-2279076","domain":"carandbike.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 13:43:03","title":"Yamaha Launches Online Sales In India Through New Website","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.carandbike.com\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fc.ndtvimg.com%2F2020-04%2Fbjg294pg_yamaha-fz25-yamaha-fzs-25-specs-listed-on-website_625x300_21_April_20.jpg&w=3840&q=75","content":"India Yamaha Motor has launched a new website with online sales facility for Yamaha two-wheelers offered on sale in India.

Following management's prepared remarks, we'll open the call for Q&A.

If we don't get to your questions on the call today, please feel free to reach out to our Investor Relations team.\n\nBefore I turn things over to Mike, let me remind you that various remarks we make on today's call regarding future expectations constitute forward-looking statements.

These documents are available on our website as are reconcilations reconciled to non-GAAP financial measures discussed on today's call.\n\nWith that, I'll now turn things over to Mike.\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Shantanu. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. Let me start on Slide 3 with an update on our ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we discussed in our last call, SunCoke has been designated an essential business and our facilities continue to operate safely. Our employees are working diligently to serve our customers with essential products and services. We continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the health and safety of our workforce, and have implemented policies and procedures that follow the guidelines established by the CDC, OSHA and local health and governmental authorities. Our COVID-19 task force continually monitors and evaluates the evolving situation and responds and adjust to the environment changes.\n\nAs we move into the second half of the year, we recognize that market conditions remain challenged. In response, we have taken significant steps to support our customers in the short-term, while simultaneously providing long-term stability for our stakeholders. Additionally, we are making investments to expand our product capabilities and diversify into new markets. On the customer side, we have addressed the lower demand environment. All of our customers have idled or banked blast furnaces during the first half of 2020. While there has been modest recovery in demand, steel capacity utilization remains low at approximately 59%, and it is difficult to predict when demand will fully return to normal levels.\n\nIn response to these unprecedented and uncertain times, we have partnered with our customers to address their near-term coke needs. In 2020, we will reduce our production by approximately 550,000 tons and now expect to produce approximately 3,750,000 tons for the whole year. Substantially, all of this reduction will occur in the second half of the year. In exchange for these near-term reductions, we have extended several of our coke contracts, as detailed on this slide.\n\nOur business model is built on long-term customer relationships. And the actions we have taken, not only address the near-term contracts that are approaching expiration, but also further strengthens our long-term customer relationships and adds meaningful certainty and stability to our business. As we temporarily ramped down production in 2020 and address market conditions and logistics services, we have taken several steps to reduce cost and optimize our operations. The impact of these actions coupled with lower volumes will result in a reduction of 2020 adjusted EBITDA of $40 million to $50 million from our previous guidance. We now expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA to be between $190 million and $200 million.\n\nWe are also evaluating our cost structure to ensure that we remain a low cost provider. We are taking meaningful actions, including a reduction in our workforce, which while difficult during these unprecedented times, will better position SunCoke for the future. We anticipate that these initiatives will result in permanent annual savings of approximately $10 million beginning in 2021.\n\nNow before I turn it over to Fay, I'm excited to talk about a new opportunity that SunCoke is pursuing. Turning to Slide 4. As mentioned on prior calls, we have been looking at alternative coke products, one of which is foundry coke. We have been evaluating foundry coke market and developing our production capabilities over the past year. After significant testing and continued development, we have now determined that we can commercially produce and sell foundry coke. We have recently successfully completed foundry coke trials with a number of potential customers, and our efforts in this area are ongoing.\n\nDomestic demand for foundry coke is approximately 600,000 tons per year. And recent shutdowns of foundry coke producers have forced foundries to look to imports as an alternative to domestic supply. We therefore believe this is an opportune time to enter the market and establish SunCoke as a long-term reliable supplier of high quality foundry product.\n\nExpansion into this market provides both industry and customer diversification. There are more than 30 foundry coke customers across the country and numerous related industrial coke customers. During the production of foundry coke, smaller-sized coke, known as egg, nut and stove coke is also produced and is utilized in other industrial applications such as sugar beet and rock wall [Phonetic] production. The production of foundry and related industrial coke helps address the current blast furnace coke market imbalance. Differences in the production process has the effect of replacing approximately two tons of blast furnace coke for each ton of foundry coke produced. Our initial target is to produce approximately 100,000 tons of foundry coke in 2021.\n\nImportantly, our ovens are capable of producing this product with no direct investment or need for production downtime to transition into the foundry coke market. We're making capital investments of approximately $12 million on coal grinding, material handling, coke screening and laboratory equipment, all of which is necessary to meet market demands. Given our cost efficient production process, we anticipate the payback period for these projects will be relatively short. We will provide additional details on foundry coke when we provide 2021 guidance early next year.\n\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Fay to review our second quarter earnings in detail. Fay?\n\nFay West -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks Mike, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to second quarter performance. As you can see on Slide 5, diluted EPS was $0.08 per share in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $0.03 per share in the second quarter of 2019. The prior year period included costs associated with the simplification transaction, which is the main driver of the increase year-over-year.\n\nLooking at adjusted EBITDA, this came in at $59 million in the second quarter of 2020 versus $63.1 million in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA from the coke operations increased $4.2 million compared to the prior year. Domestic sales volumes were approximately 54,000 tons lower than the prior year due to customer turn downs. The volume shortfall was more than offset by lower operating costs and better cost recovery. The adjusted EBITDA contribution from the Logistics segment decreased approximately $9 million versus the second quarter of 2019. Throughput volumes at CMT and the domestic terminals were approximately 2.7 million tons lower versus the prior year period.\n\nSlide 6 bridges second quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA to second quarter 2020 adjusted EBITDA. Once again, coke operations were favorable by $4.2 million, driven by strong cost control and favorable cost recovery. Logistics operations were lower $8.8 million quarter-over-quarter, mainly due to Foresight and Mercury bankruptcies. Corporate and Other was better by $0.5 million.\n\nMoving on to the next slide, you can see in the chart that our cash balance at the end of the quarter was approximately $81 million, which is a more normalized cash balance. Our cash at the beginning of the quarter was artificially high because the company increased its borrowing under its revolving credit facility by approximately $157 million in order to preserve financial flexibility. We no longer believe that enhanced cash position is necessary, and we have reduced the revolver borrowings.\n\nIn the quarter, cash flow from operations generated $21.8 million and we had capex of $14.1 million. Additionally, we paid $0.06 per share dividend in the quarter, which was a use of cash of $5 million. Today, we announced the declaration of the second quarter dividend. We established the dividend at a rate that we believe is sustainable even during challenging market conditions. And while this is a decision made quarterly by our board of directors, we believe we have ample liquidity to maintain this dividend.\n\nAt the end of the quarter, on an LTM basis, our gross leverage was 3.3 times and our net leverage was 2.96 times. Using the midpoint of our new adjusted EBITDA guidance range, our year end net leverage would be 3.65 times, which is well within our leverage covenant. Over time as market stabilizes, we intend to resume executing on our long-term capital allocation priorities with the primary focus on reducing gross leverage to 3 times or lower.\n\nSlide 8 details domestic coke operating performance and 2020 outlook. We sold 977,000 tons of coke in the quarter. Sales volumes for all facilities were impacted by the volume relief provided to our customers. Despite these volume concessions, Indiana Harbor volumes were higher than the prior year period, which was expected given the increased volumes from the rebuilt ovens.\n\nQ2 2020 adjusted EBITDA per ton was approximately $63 compared to $55 per ton in Q2 of 2019 with the per ton increase driven by favorable cost recovery and strong cost management. Looking at domestic coke on a full year basis, we now expect domestic coke to generate between $198 million and $202 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2020 on 3,750,000 tons of production. This is approximately $45 million lower than our previous adjusted EBITDA guidance, and production is estimated to be 550,000 tons lower. The decrease in volumes is offset partly by lower operating costs. Our plans have been diligent to variablize costs where possible by managing supplies and services over time, contractor usage, optimizing capital work and various other efforts.\n\nMoving to Slide 9, which summarizes the logistics business and 2020 outlook. The pandemic has impacted demand at our logistics facilities. The domestic terminal handle [Technical Issue] million tons in Q2 2020 versus 3.6 million tons in Q2 of 2019 and 2.9 million tons in Q1 of 2020. CMT volume comparisons to the prior year impacted by the bankruptcy of Foresight Energy, but were also impacted by the global effects of the pandemic. CMT had throughput volumes of 704,000 tons, which is lower than the first quarter and lower than our original guidance. In [Technical Issue] logistics operations have also taken measures to reduce costs, including a sizable reduction in our workforce as well as lowering other variable costs. [Technical Issue]\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nFay, why don't I take it from here. And again, we'll look to be at the lower end of our original guidance in the Logistics segment at $17 million.\n\nThe next slide, Slide 10, summarizes our 2020 revised guidance. We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $190 million and $200 million. This incorporates all of the volume changes we discussed as well as foundry development expenses and cost reduction activities. Our capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately $80 million, which now includes $12 million of capital for foundry coke. This amount was not contemplated in our original guidance. We have reduced our free cash flow guidance based on revised adjusted EBITDA. We now anticipate that free cash flow will be between $36 million and $52 million in 2020.\n\nWrapping up on Slide 11, as we continue to operate in these extraordinary times, our first priority continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and contractors. We will continue to do everything possible to ensure that they are well protected and able to perform their jobs with confidence. We remain focused on our core business and how to best optimize our operations, including our logistics assets.\n\nAs we discussed earlier, we have made significant progress in reducing our cost structure and adding stability by working collaboratively with our customers to address both current market challenges and longer term supply needs. We also continue to maintain our asset base to ensure that we are able to operate efficiently in the long-term even as operating levels may fluctuate in the near-term. We are proud of the investments we have made, creating the highest quality assets in the industry, which we are committed to fully utilizing and maintaining.\n\nLooking forward, we are developing a new business line in foundry coke and are confident that we will be successful and able to capture significant share in the domestic foundry market. Finally, we are fully committed the revised financial targets we have put forward and we'll make every effort to ensure that they are achieved.\n\nBefore we end our prepared remarks, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees, contractors and suppliers who are working diligently during these difficult times to keep our business operating safely.\n\nWith that, we can open up the call to Q&A.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nick Jarmoszuk with Stifel. Nick, your line is open.\n\nNicholas Jarmoszuk -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one on the foundry coke business. Can you give us a little detail as to which facility will be producing the foundry coke?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe will be producing foundry coke out of our Jewell facility. We would be able to produce that coke out of other of our facilities, but Jewell is well positioned logistically to be the most efficient producer. So we'll be producing out of Jewell.\n\nNicholas Jarmoszuk -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And then in terms of thinking about the potential EBITDA per ton margin, given that it seems like it needs to be in the coke oven for double the amount of time, can we assume that the EBITDA margins are going to be materially higher than the existing operations as well?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAs we indicated, approximately a two-for-one replacement ratio. And while we're not providing 2021 guidance today, we are saying that we expect to have a very quick payback on the $12 million investment in capital. So the margin, rather than think about it as per ton is better thought of as per unit of time. So the margins are attractive on a time basis given that it's a two-for-one replacement ratio.\n\nFay West -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nOkay. And then on the Haverhill contract, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but the way that I read it is, you'll ship tonnage to Arcelor in 2021, but then there is nothing beyond that. Is that accurate?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe have 800,000 tons coming from both facilities in '21. And '22 through '25, we anticipate shipping 400,000 from Haverhill, but we have the flexibility should we want to shift that production over to Haverhill.\n\nNicholas Jarmoszuk -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\n\nSo it's flexible as to where it can come from?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNicholas Jarmoszuk -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\n\nBetween Haverhill and Jewell?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNicholas Jarmoszuk -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And then in terms of the volume decline to Arcelor, does that indicate that they're doing something more material on their blast furnace side or how should we think about how they're sourcing their coke that they're going to need to maintain production levels?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, as it relates to their blast furnace side, that's certainly a better question for them. I think the agreements that we've reach are reflective of the current market circumstance as well as where we have clarity of a view in '21 and '22 and beyond. You shouldn't assume though that we're not in almost a constant dialog with our customers. So our discussions with ArcelorMittal and other customers are ongoing with regard to their longer term requirements for coke.\n\nNicholas Jarmoszuk -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. -- Analyst\n\nOkay. All right, that's all I had. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Castellini with Bank of America Securities. Matthew, your line is open.\n\nMatthew Castellini -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nHey guys. Thanks for taking my question. And I apologize if this was just already answered, I cut out for a bit. But -- so it seems like you're attempting to replace the lost tons from the extended contracts with this foundry coke opportunity. And so if that's lower margin, what's the differential between that and your presumably higher priced blast furnace contract tons?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nI don't want to leave an impression that it's a lower margin at all.\n\nMatthew Castellini -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOkay.\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe've made no statement to that effect.\n\nMatthew Castellini -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Got it. Thank you. Just second. Where do you think you need to get the balance sheet leverage wise over the last couple of years that support if there was sort of a reduced level of EBITDA and cash flow based on sort of the different -- the change in contracts?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, as we have said, our long-term goal continues to be three times, and we'll work toward that. I think capital allocation for 2020 is relatively spoken for in our guidance and it will remain a priority in the years ahead to reduce that debt. So as we talk about 2021, early next year, we'll provide further guidance as to what might be expected in the 2021 period. But we'll continue to look to reduce that to the three times number.\n\nMatthew Castellini -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. And just lastly, any progress on any asset sales, terminals, etc.?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nNow is really not the time to be looking at asset sales of any type. The pandemic has taken a temporary toll on not just the U.S. industrial sector, but the global economy. So our focus currently is to, as we've talked this morning, reduce our cost to the extent possible. Recognizing the lower volume levels, we've taken a lot of variable cost out of our, particularly our logistics side where even in the presence of these very, very low volumes, we've been able to maintain positive EBITDA as well as look at, on a more permanent basis, our cost structure and that's the $10 million of permanent savings, which begin in 2021.\n\nSo our focus now is to generate the $190 million to $200 million of EBITDA in 2020 given the greatly reduced volumes on both the logistics and the coke side and be as efficient as we can. As we've said many times, CMT is a very, very efficient terminal, but with the very low volumes, it's hard to demonstrate the real value of that asset. Clearly, if an opportunity at attractive and fair price were to be brought to us, we would entertain it.\n\nMatthew Castellini -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOkay, great. Thank you so much for taking the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley FBR. Lucas, your line is open.\n\nLucas Pipes -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning, Mike. And first off, congratulations on picking up this call without any operator assistance, it was quite impressive. And speaking of picking things up, obviously with the ArcelorMittal contract announcement this morning, a lot of questions around there. And it appears a little bit like a now glass half-full, glass half empty type of situation, how would you describe it and how can we get -- how do we get the glass all the way full? Thank you very much for your perspective on this.\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks for your good questions, Lucas. We tend to see the glass already as more than half full. We're pleased to have been able to support our customers this year. We're pleased with the outcome of having 800,000 tons of business from ArcelorMittal next year in addition to the 1.2 million tons that comes out of a Harbor works. But we continue to work with customers. As I said, the industry is currently operating at 59% of capacity. We don't know, I don't think anyone knows, when the industry will fully recover. But when it does, we'll be there with our efficient facilities to serve.\n\nSo in the meantime, we again focus on our cost. The addition of foundry to our customer mix, as I said, we're targeting 100,000 next year that replaces 200,000 tons of blast furnace coke. So we've got 800,000, plus if you use the two-for-one replacement ratio, you've got 200,000 tons equivalent of foundry going out next year. We're not stopping at 100 in foundry, there should be no impression of that. It's a 600,000 ton market. And we are going to look to achieve significant market share in that space. We didn't enter this market with the idea of 100,000 tonnes of foundry sales.\n\nThat's an initial estimate, our first year in the business. Trials with potential customers have gone very, very well. So we looked at good success in foundry. So we're going to pursue foundry hard. And we're, again, in dialog with our blast furnace customers as their markets continue to recover. So that's the focus.\n\nLucas Pipes -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst\n\nVery helpful, Mike. I appreciate that. And two quick questions. One, on foundry coke, why now? Is there something that's -- that has allowed this to kind of go make more sense now than in years prior? And then secondly, a very impressive coke margin per ton during the second quarter, can you expand on what's been behind that? And is this a margin that's sustainable as we look ahead into 2021 and beyond? Thank you very much for your perspective on this.\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nSure. We're not going to start to preview 2021 in this call. But the teams have been working very hard, and I'm very proud of the efforts that all of our coke-producing assets have turned in this year. We've looked to variablize our cost where we can given the lower volume levels, and we're taking our fixed or structural cost as well. So I'm very, very pleased with the cost discipline that everyone's been able to evidence this year.\n\nThere is no reason to think that we can't maintain that kind of discipline. Certain cost will come back because they are variable, but we're not doing anything to take any risks with regard to the long-term reliability of our assets. So we're not in any way starving an asset. You can do that in the short-term, you can cut back on R&M and save some costs. That's not what's going on here. So we're not sacrificing our future to generate these kind of margins today.\n\nYour first question on the foundry side, why now, it's really, Lucas, it goes back over a year. We saw over a year ago that certain of the foundry producers, domestic producers were shutting down. We saw foundry customers looking to import. So we started to take a very serious review of our ability to profitably produce this product in a very reliable, very consistent way to meet customer demand. So it goes back a while.\n\nWe also of course hear the same things you do about blast furnace participation market share in the future, and we thought it advisable to develop into another market. So we've put a lot of work into this. And clearly, no one could have foresaw the pandemic and the effects on demand in the domestic steel segments. So the timing was not motivated by the current challenges that the market faces. But clearly, it's fortuitous that it all came together with regard to us proving out the ability to produce in this time period. So it's really not a new idea here at SunCoke, but rather it's something we've been working on, like I say for over a year. So it's not new. And the value of participating in the market, the ideas of diversification of market and customer aren't new to us either.\n\nLucas Pipes -- B. Riley FBR -- Analyst\n\nVery good to hear. Mike and team, really appreciate the efforts and continue. Best of luck. Thank you.\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Lucas.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your final question comes from the line of Matthew Sandschafer with Mesirow Financial. Matthew, your line is open.\n\nMatthew Sandschafer -- Mesirow Financial -- Analyst\n\nHi. A couple of quick questions. What percentage of the foundry coke market right now is supplied by imports?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nI think this year it's probably in a 150,000 ton range a quarter.\n\nMatthew Sandschafer -- Mesirow Financial -- Analyst\n\n150,000 a quarter of it. So who do you -- I guess, how do you expect to take market share otherwise domestically if you want to grow beyond that 100k? Are there other projects [Phonetic] currently planned or are you going to have to actually go out and take customers in competitive situations?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, our focus is to be a long-term reliable supplier, no different than what we have with our integrated customers. If we make a quality product and we do so reliably and we're cost efficient, market share will naturally come to us. Customers, whether it's steel customers, whether it's foundry coke customers, they look for diversity in their supply base for a variety of good reasons, and we'll stand ready to really be a preeminent supplier. We've made the investments. So we've got good balance sheet. We have the ability to commit ourselves through this market for the long-term, no different than the integrated blast furnace market. So we're going to earn our way by, again, producing a reliable high quality coke product in the cost-efficient manner.\n\nMatthew Sandschafer -- Mesirow Financial -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And then on the topic of the ArcelorMittal extensions, what does the cost structure look like at Jewell and Haverhill now with the new volume levels? Are these levels -- can you make enough money that it makes sense to continue to invest in these assets given the high fixed costs -- well, high capital intensity of the business?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, the answer -- the short answer is yes. We have the newest coke oven fleet in North America, that's an advantage for us. We're a low-cost producer. We're not going to starve ourselves out of that leading position. At typical year, R&M capital is in the $65 million, $70 million range. And we expect to be able to continue to invest and maintain the integrity of our assets even though volumes are off here this year, and we have some work to do to fully fill our facilities out ahead. We'll do that from a good asset position not a deteriorating asset position.\n\nMatthew Sandschafer -- Mesirow Financial -- Analyst\n\nSo the expectation is not -- the expectation is you're going to try to fill out the Jewell and Haverhill demand portfolio rather than reduce capacity?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\n100% correct.\n\nMatthew Sandschafer -- Mesirow Financial -- Analyst\n\nOkay. And so I guess back to the same sort of question about the foundry coke. Where does that demand come from do you think in the environment we're in currently? I know that you guys are -- have the best assets, but I also know that a large customer is choosing to not commit to buying coke from you guys at that kind of level three years from now.\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe foundry market like our markets in the U.S. is currently off a bit. We expect it to recover. Foundry is -- it's not like blast furnaces. There is a lot of sub-markets within the foundry market. There's over 30 customers that we're currently working to develop relationships. And they're everything from ductile iron pipe producers to people who make manhole covers. Frank shafts, engine blocks for trucks, there's just a variety of users, and we expect that industrial America will in time recover.\n\nMatthew Sandschafer -- Mesirow Financial -- Analyst\n\nRight. I guess, the second question, are you planning to sell -- are you planning to drive the volumes on the blast furnace coke back up beyond the 400,000 at Jewell and Haverhill? Are you looking to fill out primarily with foundry?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell...\n\nMatthew Sandschafer -- Mesirow Financial -- Analyst\n\nWhich the market doesn't seem they're going to support that. I guess, I'm just trying to figure out that the hole here created by the new contract is pretty large a couple of years out, I'm just trying to figure out what the components are to fill it up?\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Well, it will be again both with our traditional blast furnace customers as well as our continued success in foundry. For example, you assumed 50% of the foundry market as 300,000 tons, which is 600,000 tons of our blast furnace coke.\n\nMatthew Sandschafer -- Mesirow Financial -- Analyst\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Thanks, Matthew.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Rippey for closing remarks.\n\nMichael G. Rippey -- President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. And thank you all for joining us on the call this morning and your continued interest in SunCoke. And we'll look forward if not able currently to visit in person, certainly take your calls as the period unfolds. So thanks again and have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Closing Remarks]\n\nDuration: 36 minutes\n\nCall participants:\n\nShantanu Agrawal -- Director of Investor Relations\n\nMichael G.

Human ingenuity, however, has sprung too, and we\u2019ve seen the best (supermarket creativity) and worst (toilet paper disputes) of humanity.\n\nSpeaking of, one (domestic) first class American Airlines passengers\u2019 genius response to COVID takes the cake tray table this week.\n\nJames Asquith, founder and CEO of home exchange company Holiday Swap (and the youngest man to visit all 196 countries) recently took to Instagram in an astronaut outfit, which he somehow managed to convince airport security to let him on board an American Airlines flight with.\n\n\u201cTaking COVID flying protection to a new level,\u201d he captioned the post. \u201cI would like to think that someone captured m[e] on their instagram calling me a total bellend on last nights redeye flight.\u201d\n\n\u201cFavourite pastime is annoying airlines (in a light hearted way). This one was a challenge,\u201d Asquith added.\n\n\u201cSecurity: Why is there an astronaught helmet in your bag? Crew: This guy has a screw loose. Me: can this plane get to 150,000ft so I can see my homies on the International Space Station.\u201d\n\nAsquith\u2019s followers response suggested, had they been on the flight, they would have appreciated it.\n\nOne wrote: \u201cBest lighthearted post yet. I flew delta and AA this past month and the difference was polarizing. AA only seem to care about profits while ignoring on-board social distancing. The flight departed PACKED from Florida, epicenter, of the US.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell this is amazing and I now need to find a space suit on eBay,\u201d commented another.\n\nYet another took the chance to have a gratuitous crack at American\u2019s renowned sub par culinary offering: \u201cSurprised you didn\u2019t mention the culinary \u2018slop\u2019 in front of you.\u201d\n\nBeyond providing passengers with a breath of light-hearted air in these heavy times, the post may not be as ludicrous as it seems. Though Asquith would not have been able to (easily) eat with the helmet in place, while airline safety measures reportedly give you an almost vanishing (1\/4300) chance of getting Covid-19 on a full 2-hour flight and while it\u2019s hardly the most comfortable way to spend a trip, there is some (small) reason his antics might be considered more than a publicity stunt.\n\nWhy?

IBM reports (via the New York Times) that computing pioneer and company fellow Frances Allen died of Alzheimer\u2019s on her birthday, August 4th, at the age of 88. She\u2019s best known for making vital contributions to compilers, or the software that turns raw code into fast-running executables. From 1966 onward, she and scientist John Cocke wrote papers detailing algorithms and frameworks that helped compilers become much more efficient \u2014 if you\u2019ve ever built an app, you likely owe something to Allen\u2019s work.\n\nShe and her peers also made progress on parallel computing, where tasks are shared across systems to speed up their completion.\n\nAllen was also instrumental to advancing women in technology. Apart from being one of the relatively few women participating in early work on computers (she joined IBM as a code instructor in 1957), she made a point to support women and served as a mentor. Half the experimental compiler group at IBM was made of women during the 1970s and 1980s. She was the first woman to become an IBM Fellow, receiving the distinction in 1989. She was also the first to win a Turing Award, in 2006, and an upcoming IEEE award will be named after her.\n\nIn those lights, Allen\u2019s work will likely persist for a very long time to come. The apps on your computer or phone depend on the speed that comes from modern compilers, and Allen helped crack the door open for more inclusiveness in tech. She\u2019ll be missed."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk\/news\/tv\/morning-viewers-angered-alice-beer-18708107","domain":"manchestereveningnews.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-03 16:34:00","title":"This Morning viewers angered as Alice Beer exposes Eat Out to Help Out takeaway loophole","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/v2\/media\/bSoZUgjo\/poster.jpg","content":"Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners.

They can't manage this, they can't police this, so of course, there are loopholes which I am sure customers will find.\"\n\nBut viewers were annoyed that this goes against what the scheme is about as while being good for people's pockets, it's also about getting businesses up and running again.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnd the frustration was ramped up further as it's nearly a week since travel expert Simon Calder was slammed for 'irresponsible' advice after he pointed out a Spain quarantine loophole.\n\nOne viewer wrote: \"Loophole to find.. LOL. Not now, everyone watching This Morning now know a Loophole... great TV people!!\"\n\n\"Why did she go to KFC and not an independent restaurant which would've probably benefited from the publicity of using #EatOutToHelpOut ? #ThisMorning,\" another said.\n\nA third added: \"@thismorning what is going on with you lot?

But while the ability to remotely control your lighting, including adjusting color, intensity and brightness is great, one of its more recent products focuses more on how to turn all those connected lights into a dynamic, at-home interactive entertainment experience. The Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box is a relatively simple device that sits between your video sources, including things like game consoles and the Apple TV, and your television, enabling synced light shows that can take advantage of a wide range of Hue products.\n\nThe basics\n\nThe Hue Play HDMI Sync Box is at its core an HDMI switcher, offering four HDMI inputs and a single HDMI output. Signals from your input devices (e.g., Apple TV, Roku, Xbox, PS4, etc.) go into the box and are passed through to the TV, with switching happening automatically depending on which device was most recently active (you can also change them manually with the app and with voice controls).\n\nThe Sync Box supports a range of modern quality standards for display and audio. It supports 4K 60Hz resolution, HDR10+ and Dolby Vision standards, as well as Dolby Atmos surround sound. It also supports HDMI 2.0b with HDCP 2.2 compliance for copyright protection.\n\nYou will need not only Hue colored lights, but also a Hue Bridge (the second-generation, rounded-square version) to ensure that the Hue Sync Box is more than just a particularly expensive HDMI hub, but it does that job very well, too. If you do have Hue products, like the Hue Play light bars that can easily mount on top of your TV stand or to the back of your TV itself, or the Hue Signe multicolored floor or table lamps, then you can use the Sync companion app to ensure your lights reflect what\u2019s going on on screen \u2014 for any video that plays through the box from any source.\n\nDesign and performance\n\nWhy would you want this? Well, mostly because it looks really, really cool. Hue Sync has already been available as a software feature for you to use with video played back on Macs and PCs when used in combination with a monitoring tool. But that has a lot of limitations, including not being able to work with official Netflix apps and Netflix in the browser. The Sync Box eliminates any potential roadblocks and also means you can use regular streaming and gaming sources without having to run a media center PC.\n\nThe box itself is relatively large, but that seems like it\u2019s mostly to accommodate the multiple HDMI ports. It\u2019s very short, despite being about twice the surface area of an Apple TV, so it should be very easy to integrate into your existing home theatre setup, whatever that entails.\n\nSetting up the Hue Play HDMI Sync Box is very easy and requires only installing the app and pressing the sync button on your Hue Bridge when instructed to do so. As mentioned, you can plug in up to four sources and the box will switch between them automatically when you use an input device or you can also manually change the input (and rename them) using the app. The app also allows you to tweak the intensity, brightness and responsiveness of the light, making it more subtle or more extreme, depending on your preferences and your activity. A \u201cGame\u201d setting, for instance, sets it to maximum intensity and responsiveness for a more dynamic effect befitting fast-paced interactive content.\n\nI found that the lighting was extremely good at mimicking the colors and brightness of a scene, especially if you take the time to accurately set up the position of your Hue lights for a dedicated \u201centertainment area\u201d in the official main Hue app. It\u2019s an effect that, when used in its most subtle settings, can basically fade away but still provide genuine enhancement for the watching experience, making it feel more immersive. At its maxed out settings, it\u2019s much more noticeable, but still something that basically fades away into the background over an extended period of use, in a good way.\n\nEspecially since the firmware update, the Hue Play Sync Box has proven a fantastic addition to my home theater setup, providing an extra bit of flair to every TV watching experience. It\u2019s obviously more effective in dark rooms, but it really seems to especially complement high-quality OLED screens that produce vibrant colors and true, deep blacks.\n\nBottom line\n\nThe Hue Play HDMI Sync Box is a bit of an extravagance at $229.99, but it definitely adds to the overall home TV-watching experience, for movies, streaming and for gaming. The four HDMI inputs mean you can also use it to add more ports to your TV, if that\u2019s something you need, and the recent updates mean you\u2019re not going to sacrifice any video quality while doing so."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.gizmodo.com.au\/2020\/08\/tesla-stock-five-for-one-split-deal\/","domain":"gizmodo.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-12 04:23:00","title":"Tesla Shares Go Into Overdrive After Five-For-One Stock Split","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/app\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Space-Debris.jpg","content":"Here\u2019s What TurboTax\u2019s Boss Doesn\u2019t Want You to Hear\n\nThis follows the failure of another satellite from the same series that may have been due to a meteoroid impact.\n\nTech News\n\nSurreal Gambling Site Sees Users Bet on Thousands of Dimly Lit and Short-Lived Soccer Matches Every Day\n\nThe gambling website of dubious origins has millions of daily visitors for table tennis, air hockey, and bench soccer.

We will explain to the government that this notification has created confusion. A vehicle is tested, manufactured and sold as an integrated unit where the OEM is responsible for the warranty\u201d, Babu lashed.He further added, \u201cEither charging or swapping is post-sale charge replenishing methods. Both can exist in the current framework.\u201dEchoing same concerns, Saurav Kumar, Founder and CEO, Euler Motors added, \"In case a consumer purchases a battery from another company, how does one ensure that safety standards will be met. So if the vehicles and batteries are not tested together, there could be issues with the performance and safety of the vehicles.\"He further pointed, \"When vehicles and batteries are from different suppliers, how does any issue due to the battery impact the warranty benefits for the customer is another question left unanswered.\"However, Chetan Maini Vice Chairman and Co-Founder of the battery swapping firm Sun Mobility beg to differ here as there is no issue on the safety or concerns from OEMs, according to him.\"All vehicles need to be ARAI certified with batteries. So all the norms are met. However an OEM may certify there vehicle with multiple batteries from different suppliers. In the registration, they don't have to mention the battery type but ofcourse its certified. Just like an OEM certifies multiple tires the registration does not need to mention the type of tire. It's important that this is clarified\", Maini explained.This will help the OEMs as they have multiple options and also the customer. SMEV ) has also sought clarifications from the government on various aspects of the policy because under FAME, the incentives are given based on the size of the vehicle battery.Delinking batteries is a good idea, feels Sohinder Gill, Director General, SMEV (Society of) however a lot needs to be done before it becomes practically implementable and beneficial to the customers.The retail two-wheeler market is highly sensitive to pricing so in addition to favorable TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), the lower upfront cost is essential for the mass adoption of electric two-wheelers among retail customers.Gill opined that in the case of B2C customers, EVs still have to be purchased along with the battery as there are hardly any battery swapping\/ rental\/leasing business models sufficiently available across India. Only a few companies like Ola, Sun Mobility, Lithion, are currently operating in the battery swapping space in India.However, the notification makes good sense in the B2B segment where the players can have captive swapping stations and business models for the battery as a service are emerging. Two-wheeler fleets are likely to shift to EVs much more rapidly.Suraj Ghosh, Principal Analyst at IHS Markit told ETAuto, \u201cThe gig-economy, which already contributes heavily towards the demand for two-wheeler EVs, will find more value in such alternatives and could further boost demand.\u201dDock-less ride-sharing companies, delivery fleets like Swiggy are already charting out plans to go electric. For fleets, considering massively low operating costs, not going electric would be a costly mistake.E-rickshaws is the other category that has grown rapidly in the last 5 years. Currently, the e-rickshaw market is around 0.7 million units a year.Close to 50 percent of this market is completely unorganized and unregulated. The cost of an e-rickshaw from an unorganized-unregulated market to a fully organized-regulated market ranges from INR 80K to about INR 130K.Currently, a majority of the electric three-wheeler market is based on lead-acid batteries. A shift from lead-acid to lithium makes complete sense right now. Fleet based three-wheeler operations have already started to use Li-ion.However, the problem of higher upfront costs has been dampening Li-ion adoption in the e-rickshaw market at a larger scale. The good quality, regulation-compliant e-rickshaw with lead-acid batteries cost around INR 130K. The same would cost around INR 190K with Li-ion batteries.Suraj Ghosh commented, \u201cWith swappable batteries, the price parity gap with ICEs will be narrowed and TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) calculations will also become simpler for average customers to understand and appreciate the benefits of EVs. Also, the need for dense charging points can be negated in this model.The policy is further expected to reduce the overall cost of acquisition of the product by saving an amount in the vehicle registration procedure, thus offering affordability. It will further boost prospects for new business models like battery swapping and leasing.There is a common consensus among all the EV players that the separation of batteries from EVs must reflect in the GST rates for both.Chetan Maini emphasised, \u201cWhile GST for EVs is at 5 percent, for EV batteries, it is at 18 percent--this must be reduced to 5 percent. Similarly, GST for chargers is at 5 percent and GST for charging and battery swapping services is at 18 percent\u2014this needs to be reduced to 5 percent as well. Such changes can significantly benefit the end customer and increase adoption.\u201dEchoing similar views, Naveen Munjal, Managing Director of Hero Electric said, \u201cSome other policy announcements should have been made along-with this policy to make it a more attractive proposition like the reduction of GST of batteries from 18 to 5 percent if sold separately and mechanism of passing on the FAME subsidy to such EVs as currently subsidy is calculated on the battery power.The move will also pave the way for more players coming up in new innovative business models, such as battery leasing and battery swapping, said Maini. It will encourage an array of energy service providers to be part of the EV ecosystem.\u201dCommenting on the move an Ola spokesperson added, \"This decision will help in the creation of an indigenous battery swapping industry and address various customer pain points in adoption of EVs and address range anxiety issues. This decision will not only solve for the improved access to EV energy infrastructure but also create large employment and economic opportunities that will contribute towards India emerging stronger in these unprecedented times.\u201d"},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/markets\/stocks\/news\/when-first-globals-devina-mehra-spotted-muscle-man-potential-in-boy-hdfc-bank\/articleshow\/77520022.cms","domain":"economictimes.indiatimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 06:58:00","title":"When First Global\u2019s Devina Mehra spotted \u2018muscle man\u2019 potential in \u2018boy\u2019 HDFC Bank","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.etimg.com\/photo\/msid-76920425,quality-100\/et-logo.jpg","content":"You Might Also Like: Dividend-paying stocks emerge alternative to bank FDs for some\n\nYou Might Also Like: World\u2019s most favoured bank stock misses India market rebound\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW DELHI: Devina Mehra of First Global tells an interesting story! She spotted the potential in the HDFC Bank stock way back in 1996, but there was an element of something extra there: the top brass at the newest lender had come in from Citibank , where she herself was their colleague.That was when the stock traded at an adjusted price range of Rs 3-4. \u201cMy experience of working under them gave valuable extra insights,\u201d says she.In 1996, Devina put out her analysis of the HDFC Bank stock \u2013 just a couple of years after she founded First Global with her former Citibank colleague and life partner Shankar Sharma . Her firm gave a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation when the stock was trading at Rs 38 (before a 10:1 split). The market-cap of the lender was Rs 760 crore then.She did not set any price target as per her firm's policies, but the report said the \u2018boy\u2019 would turn into a \u2018muscle man\u2019 in five years.Did she think it will emerge a multibagger stock and become one of India\u2019s most-preferred blue chip one day?\u201cWe did think it would do very well. And yes, we had it featured prominently in our \u2018Emerging Blue Chip Conference\u2019 in 1999,\u201d she recalls.The stock just took off thereafter. \u201cWe did think it was headed to blue chip status. But no one, not even Aditya Puri , could have predicted what happened over the next 25 years. No one can look 25 years ahead,\" she said.Since 1996, HDFC Bank has delivered a mindboggling 30,247 per cent returns. In cash terms, it would mean Rs 100 invested in the stock back then would have become over Rs 30 lakh now. In comparison, the 30-share pack Sensex added 1,177 per cent in the same period.\u201cThrilled to see it. The 'Baby' to 'Arnold Schwarzenegger' transformation happened before our eyes, didn't it?,\u201d Devina said in a tweet this past week, sharing an image of the first report on the lender.Not that her insight on the insiders alone helped Devina form a view on the stock. There were solid fundamental reasons too. In the 90s, Indian banking was dominated by public sector banks. \u201cGood companies did not want to work with small banks. ICICI Bank was the only other viable private bank, and there was space for professional lenders,\u201d Devina recalls.HDFC Bank has delivered stellar growth year after year ever since under the leadership of Aditya Puri, who is scheduled to retire as CEO this October. In that, he has also become the longest-serving head of any private bank in the country.The bank last week named Sashidhar Jagdishan, a bank insider since 1996, as Puri\u2019s successor.Sharing her insights on Puri\u2019s strategy, Devina Mehra believes the bank's risk management: for example, the decision to not take large exposures in the booming infra space then and eventual entry into retail banking worked wonderfully for the company.Dalal Street is currently divided on the prospects of domestic banks and financial institutions because of projections of an imminent spike in bad loans when the EMI holiday that came in as a Covid-19 relief comes to an end this month.While many analysts say it is the perfect time to invest in these beaten-down stocks, another half of them are advising investors to avoid them completely.Devina falls in the latter camp, and says she is bullish not on the banking space today, as the economy is in dire straits, hit by the pandemic and the consequential demand destruction, which will impact both asset quality and credit offtake.Despite this general aversion towards banking stocks, HDFC Bank remains a favourite among analysts. On the publicly available Reuters Eikon database, 21 analysts had \u2018buy\u2019 recommendations on the stock and a similar number had \u2018outperform\u2019 ratings as of August 11. There were three \u2018hold\u2019 and one \u2018underperform\u2019 ratings.Devina\u2019s tip for investors in the current market? \u201cTactical asset allocation is the way to go. Apart from single assets, people should also avoid single country risk and diversify globally.

The oil watchdog wiped almost a quarter of a million barrels of oil a day (bpd) from its forecasts for next year after warning that the rising number of Covid-19 cases could mean a slower recovery for the global aviation industry and lower demand for transport fuels. In its latest monthly report, the IEA cut its global oil demand forecasts, for the first time since the start of the pandemic, by 140,000 barrels of oil to 91.9m bpd in 2020. The forecast is more than 8m bpd lower than the global demand for oil last year. The IEA also downgraded its expectations for 2021, cutting 240,000 bpd from its previous forecasts to an average of 97.1m bpd next year as the global aviation industry struggles to return to normal.

At least, that\u2019s the message from Watches of Switzerland, which has reported that sales jumped 7.4% year-on-year in July as its shops reopened after the lockdown. Increased domestic demand is offsetting the impact of lower tourism, said the company, which is the UK\u2019s largest retailer for Rolex, Cartier, OMEGA, TAG Heuer and Breitling watches. It also posted a 4.8% jump in revenues for the 12 months to April, having opened five new stores and refurbished another nine last year. CEO Brian Duffy explains: The UK has been driven by continued strong ecommerce sales and domestic demand in regional stores, partly offsetting greater declines in London (due to reduced tourism) and our airport stores. Here\u2019s the FT\u2019s take:\n\nWith global travel still frozen and high-end leisure spending in the doldrums, rich consumers are spending their money on luxury watches, boosting the retailer Watches of Switzerland. Shares in the group jumped 18 per cent on Thursday after it reported that increased demand from well-heeled UK consumers had partly offset a lack of tourists. Group sales rose 4.8 per cent in the year to April 26, despite many stores in the UK and US being closed for the final portion of that year.

The latest figures from the labor department showed 963,000 people filing claims after 20 weeks of claims above 1m. Claims still remain historically high. Before the pandemic claims were averaging around 200,000 a week and the previous record for claims was 695,000, set in 1982. The latest figures come as millions of unemployed Americans are dealing with the end of a $600 boost to their unemployment benefits. The extra payments, agreed by Congress in March, ended last month and Congress remains deadlocked over an extension. Donald Trump has signed an executive order that would boost payments by $400 a week but the order could take months to implement and cash-strapped states \u2013 some of which are already out of money \u2013 are expected to contribute to the plan.

Tens of millions of people are still collecting unemployment benefits at a level far above the worst points of the Great Recession.

An overhaul of this scale will require significant movements in the M&A market if it is to be delivered in the targeted timeframe,\" Will Scargill, managing oil and gas analyst at analytics firm GlobalData, wrote in an Aug. 5 note.\n\nLondon-based BP plans to high-grade its asset base, refocusing its oil, gas and refining portfolio \u2014 the foundations of its once core business \u2014 to be more resilient in the coming years, BP Executive Vice President of Strategy and Sustainability Giulia Chierchia said during the company's Aug. 4 second-quarter earnings call.\n\n\"In terms of its traditional oil and gas segment, BP will need to offload assets that are not high-grade to hit its targets of improving returns on capital from a reduced asset base. Assets most likely to be put on the market are legacy positions with little growth potential,\" Scargill said.\n\nBP's organic production is set to flatline through 2025 and then decline by 2030, Raymond James energy analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an Aug. 6 email. Together with asset sales, volumes in 2030 are expected to be 40% below 2019 levels. Analysts said BP could put noncore assets in Angola, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates up for sale. However, Molchanov said it is too early to determine which holdings the company might put on the auction block.\n\n\"Because this will be a decade-long process, the pace of asset sales will be done opportunistically based on market conditions. It is much more important to get the deals done right rather than simply sell something for the sake of selling something. It is too early to predict which specific assets will be sold,\" Molchanov said.\n\nBP will complete all existing projects but will not explore for oil in any new countries, executives said during the call. BP's oil and gas production is expected to fall from 2.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019 to 1.5 million boe\/d by 2030 and its refinery throughput volumes are likely to drop from 1.7 million barrels per day to around 1.2 million bbl\/d in the next 10 years.\n\n\"These [production decline] numbers do not include our shareholding in Rosneft, which is a fundamental part of our broader portfolio, providing us with a strong position in Russia,\" Chierchia said.\n\nChierchia made it clear that BP will retain its 19.75% stake in Russia's largest crude oil producer Public Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Co., known as Rosneft, which comprises a sizeable chunk of nearly 30% of BP's total production profile.\n\nBP also remains committed to its U.S. onshore oil and gas shale business, known as BPX Energy. The unit, formed after BP's $10.5 billion acquisition of holdings from BHP Billiton Group at the end of 2018, represented BP's return to the unconventional exploration and production space.\n\n\"BPX remains core to the business and continues to do really well,\" BP CFO Murray Auchincloss said during the call.\n\n\"The cash generated by hydrocarbons will be key to supporting the transition into our two growth areas: low-carbon electricity and energy, and customer convenience and mobility. And we expect to be directing 40% or likely more of our investment into these areas by 2030,\" BP CEO Bernard Looney said during the call.\n\nDespite the recent oil price collapse, BP has proceeded with several asset divestitures in the last few months, agreeing to sell its global petrochemicals unit to INEOS Ltd. for $5 billion, a deal that allowed BP to reach its initial $15 billion asset sale target a year earlier than initially scheduled.\n\nIn July, BP inked a deal to sell its interests in the Andrew Area in the central U.K. North Sea and its nonoperating stake in the Shearwater field to Premier Oil PLC. In the last few years, major companies in the U.S. and European oil space have been dumping aging North Sea assets to focus on other, more cost-effective areas.\n\nAlso in July, BP exited another noncore market, completing the sale of its upstream business in Alaska to Hilcorp Energy Company for $5.6 billion. The deal included BP's entire upstream and midstream business in Alaska, comprised of BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., which held all of BP's upstream oil and gas interests in Alaska, as well as BP Pipelines (Alaska) Inc.'s interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline System."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/thespinoff.co.nz\/society\/09-08-2020\/us-high-roller-estate-agent-hawks-billionaires-retreat-in-covid-free-new-zealand\/","domain":"thespinoff.co.nz","published_date":"2020-08-09 07:55:18","title":"US high-roller estate agent hawks 'billionaire's retreat in Covid-free NZ'","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.thespinoff.co.nz\/1\/2020\/08\/1823633-701920-Stelvio_069-Large-e1596959660823.jpg?w=1290","content":"Celebrity agent Ryan Serhant is promoting the sale, a snip at $24 million.

That exceeded expectations, as employers added about 1.8 million jobs to their payrolls. That adds up to good news for the U.S. economy. But some may wonder what the unemployment rate actually means \u2014 and why it's important.\n\nwatch now\n\nFinancial hardship\n\nThe unemployment rate measures how many people who want a job (and are available for work) can find one. July's unemployment rate indicates that roughly 1 in every 10 people in the labor force can't find work. The unemployment rate is typically an indicator of hardship for American families, Stephen Woodbury, a labor economist and professor at Michigan State University, has told CNBC. More from Personal Finance:\n\nYou might not see cash from a payroll tax cut\n\nHow much your next stimulus check could be\n\n5 ways to create your own stimulus check That's because an unemployed person's income drops after losing a job. Unemployment insurance generally provides a temporary stopgap, but these state-administered benefits usually replace less than half of prior wages. And in some states, the average worker gets far less, around 30% of former wages. Many workers also aren't eligible for jobless pay at all. April's unemployment rate of 14.7% was higher than any other period since the Great Depression, when economists predicted it peaked around 25%.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nAnd the employment situation soured far more quickly than at any other point in history. It took just a few months for unemployment to rise to April's peak; by comparison, it took more than a year for the Depression-era unemployment rate to witness an equivalent increase. But it steadily improved over the past three months as states gradually reopened their economies. Some experts expected renewed shutdown measures in some states, an effort to contain spiking coronavirus infections, to potentially cause the unemployment rate to worsen.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nIn July, the unemployment rate was 10.2% and 16.3 million people were unemployed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. To put that in perspective, those figures are respectively 6.7 percentage points and 10.6 million people higher than in February, before the U.S. pandemic.\n\n$600 a week\n\nUp until recently, the unemployment rate wasn't as accurate an indicator of financial stress as in the past. A federal financial-relief law, the CARES Act, increased unemployment benefits for out-of-work Americans by $600 a week starting in April. That supplement was in addition to typical state benefits. The CARES Act also expanded the pool of workers eligible for benefits.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nThe extra $600 made unemployment benefits more generous than any other time in the program's history, according to economists. But that aid lapsed at the end of July, and many are having trouble finding jobs. Workers in some states are now getting as little as $5 or $10 a week.\n\nFurloughed workers\n\nThe unemployment rate may also mask other important labor dynamics at play. For example, the unemployment rate includes furloughed workers, who were temporarily laid off from a job. They are technically still attached to an employer and can return to work quickly if business rebounds. Around 56% of unemployed Americans \u2014 or about 9.2 million people \u2014 are actually furloughed. While historically elevated, that share fell from a peak of about 78% in April. That suggests the unemployment rate could potentially reverse quickly if the job losses don't become permanent.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nThe unemployment rate also doesn't include the share of Americans who dropped out of the labor force because they were discouraged and decided not to look for work, for example. A large share of people leaving the labor force would make the unemployment rate appear artificially low. \"That isn't necessarily good, because these are maybe people who are discouraged and would like a job but concluded they can't get one,\" Woodbury said. The share of \"discouraged workers\" is up from February, rising to 665,000 people from 405,000.\n\nOther measures\n\nOther measures may be more useful than the unemployment rate in demonstrating the relative employment hardship of Americans, according to some experts. The employment-population ratio, for example, measures the share of employment among the entire adult population \u2014 not just those looking for work. It therefore captures adults who were discouraged about the prospects of finding a job, for example.\n\nZoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards\n\nThe ratio is perhaps the best snapshot of labor demand, or the number of jobs available for people, Woodbury said. That share recovered a bit in July compared with April \u2014 growing to 55.1% from 51.3%, which was a historic low in the post-World War II era."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20200805005512\/en\/Clean-Harbors-Announces-Second-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results","domain":"businesswire.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 11:30:00","title":"Clean Harbors Announces Second-Quarter 2020 Financial Results","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/images\/bwlogo_extreme.png","content":"NORWELL, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Clean Harbors, Inc. (\u201cClean Harbors\u201d) (NYSE: CLH), the leading provider of environmental and industrial services throughout North America, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020.\n\n\u201c Our second-quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our business model and our organization\u2019s ability to effectively respond to a crisis,\u201d said Alan S. McKim, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201c The COVID-19 pandemic forced shutdowns across North America, which began to impact many of our markets and customers. In response, we enacted a comprehensive series of actions, including developing safety protocols to protect our workforce, rapidly reducing costs, lowering our capital spending, partially shutting down work locations, temporarily closing nearly half our re-refinery capacity and launching a comprehensive COVID-19 emergency response service offering.\u201d\n\nSecond-Quarter 2020 Results\n\nRevenues were $710.0 million compared with $868.7 million in the same period of 2019. Income from operations was $60.2 million compared with $73.0 million in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nNet income was $29.0 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. This compares with net income of $36.2 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, for the same period in 2019. Adjusted for certain items in both periods, adjusted net income was $28.9 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2020, compared with adjusted net income of $36.9 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, in the same period of 2019. (See reconciliation table below)\n\nAdjusted EBITDA (see description below) was $135.5 million compared with $149.8 million in the same period of 2019.\n\nQ2 2020 Review\n\n\u201c While overall profitability for the company was lower compared with a year ago, our Environmental Services segment achieved a 17% increase in Adjusted EBITDA, driven in part by our disposal facilities and decontamination work,\u201d McKim said. \u201c Incineration utilization was a robust 87% as we continued to capture high-value waste streams across our network and capitalized on the strong backlog we had entering the quarter. Landfill volumes were down 24% due to the COVID-19 related deferral of some remediation and waste projects, but our base business remained stable. Field Services revenue grew nearly 50% from a year ago as we generated $50 million in pandemic-related work in the quarter. We have now completed more than 7,000 COVID-19 responses. Certain portions of our Environmental Services segment, including Industrial Services and other lines of business, such as household hazardous waste and lab pack, were negatively impacted as a result of the virus outbreak.\n\n\u201c The pandemic also adversely impacted our Safety-Kleen segment as shelter-in-place restrictions imposed early in the quarter substantially lowered vehicle miles driven across much of the U.S. This resulted in a reduction in near-term demand for core offerings in our Safety-Kleen branch network as well as for base oil and finished lubricants in our Safety-Kleen Oil business,\u201d McKim said. \u201c Safety-Kleen revenue was down 30% from a year ago with Adjusted EBITDA declining 41%. Aggressive cost actions enabled us to partly offset lower revenue in this segment. We also significantly raised our charge-for-oil (CFO) rates for used motor oil (UMO) as crude oil prices crashed and demand for our re-refined lube oil products and other outlets for waste oil shuttered.\u201d\n\nBusiness Outlook and Financial Guidance\n\n\u201c As we enter the second half of 2020, we believe we have positioned ourselves well for the current economic environment,\u201d McKim said. \u201c Within multiple parts of our business, we have seen a measurable recovery from the lows we experienced in April as both the U.S. and Canadian economies reopened in subsequent months. While localized outbreaks have threatened to stall the progress in certain states or regions, we believe that the prudent cost actions we have taken should enable us to weather virus-related slowdowns. In addition, our emergency response business is partially offsetting lost revenue in other parts of our business. We will continue to pursue opportunities for disinfection, decontamination and disposal with impacted customers going forward.\n\n\u201c Within Environmental Services, our recycling and disposal network continues to see a steady flow of waste volumes, with no meaningful decline from most of our large-quantity generators. We are experiencing project delays due to the virus, and some Chemical customers have recently slowed production. While that may limit our high-margin volumes in the short-term, other parts of this segment, including Industrial Services and Technical Services, are expected to ramp up in the second half of this year. Field Services is on track for a strong 2020, with anticipated COVID-related revenue of approximately $100 million for the full year.\n\n\u201c Within Safety-Kleen, we began the third quarter on a positive trajectory, but still remain below prior year levels. The branch business continues to improve as summer-related driving increases demand for our services. We are monitoring the impact of new shelter-in-place mandates, but the recent rise in COVID cases so far has not derailed our recovery in the Safety-Kleen branch business. For Safety-Kleen Oil, we have seen base oil and lubricant demand rebound and we restarted production in July at two of the four re-refineries that we had temporarily closed. We will continue to actively manage our CFO rates to reflect the value of the waste oil and the collection services we are providing.\n\n\u201c Based on the visibility into our business and end markets, we are reestablishing annual guidance. Despite continued economic uncertainties, we are confident that we can achieve these new targets given our market leadership and the actions we have taken in response to the pandemic,\u201d McKim concluded.\n\nBased on its year-to-date financial performance and current market conditions, for 2020 Clean Harbors expects:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA in the range of $470 million to $500 million, based on anticipated 2020 GAAP net income in the range of $53 million to $84 million; and\n\nAdjusted free cash flow in the range of $200 million to $230 million, based on anticipated 2020 net cash from operating activities in the range of $355 million to $405 million.\n\nNon-GAAP Results\n\nClean Harbors reports Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but viewed only as a supplement to those measurements. Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated identically by all companies, and therefore the Company\u2019s measurement of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Clean Harbors believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides additional useful information to investors since the Company\u2019s loan covenants are based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA achieved and management routinely evaluates the performance of its businesses based upon levels of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with its existing revolving credit agreement, as described in the following reconciliation showing the differences between reported net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nFor the Three Months Ended: For the Six Months Ended: June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 Net income $29,023 $36,244 $40,595 $37,220 Accretion of environmental liabilities 2,766 2,560 5,327 5,134 Depreciation and amortization 72,494 74,217 147,027 149,572 Other expense (income), net 500 564 2,865 (2,419) Loss on sale of businesses 184 \u2014 3,258 \u2014 Interest expense, net 18,654 20,215 37,441 39,979 Provision for income taxes 11,859 16,025 21,557 22,002 Adjusted EBITDA $135,480 $149,825 $258,070 $251,488 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 19.1% 17.2% 16.5% 15.2%\n\nThis press release includes a discussion of net income and earnings per share adjusted for the loss on sale of businesses, net of tax and the impacts of tax-related valuation allowances as identified in the reconciliations provided below. The Company believes that discussion of these additional non-GAAP measures provides investors with meaningful comparisons of current results to prior periods\u2019 results by excluding items that the Company does not believe reflect its fundamental business performance. The following shows the difference between net income to adjusted net income, and earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nFor the Three Months Ended: For the Six Months Ended: June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 Adjusted net income Net income $29,023 $36,244 $40,595 $37,220 Loss on sale of businesses 184 \u2014 3,258 \u2014 Tax-related valuation allowances (305) 656 626 4,762 Adjusted net income $28,902 $36,900 $44,479 $41,982 Adjusted earnings per share Earnings per share $0.52 $0.65 $0.73 $0.66 Loss on sale of businesses \u2014 \u2014 0.06 \u2014 Tax-related valuation allowances \u2014 0.01 0.01 0.09 Adjusted earnings per share $0.52 $0.66 $0.80 $0.75\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Reconciliation\n\nClean Harbors reports adjusted free cash flow, which it considers to be a measurement of liquidity that provides useful information to investors about its ability to generate cash. The Company defines adjusted free cash flow as net cash from operating activities excluding cash impacts of items derived from non-operating activities, less additions to property, plant and equipment plus proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets. The Company excludes cash impacts of items derived from non-operating activities such as taxes paid in connection with divestitures and in the current period have also excluded cash paid in connection with the purchase of its corporate headquarters and certain capital improvements to the site as these expenditures are considered one-time in nature. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net cash from operating activities or other measurements under GAAP. Adjusted free cash flow is not calculated identically by all companies, and therefore the Company\u2019s measurement of adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nAn itemized reconciliation between net cash from operating activities and adjusted free cash flow is as follows for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):\n\nFor the Three Months Ended: For the Six Months Ended: June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 Adjusted free cash flow Net cash from operating activities $139,805 $108,730 $173,486 $138,470 Additions to property, plant and equipment (42,954) (59,425) (125,721) (118,372) Purchase and capital improvements of corporate HQ 345 \u2014 21,080 \u2014 Proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets 951 3,068 3,101 7,389 Adjusted free cash flow $98,147 $52,373 $71,946 $27,487\n\nAdjusted EBITDA Guidance Reconciliation\n\nAn itemized reconciliation between projected GAAP net income and projected Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in millions):\n\nFor the Year Ending\n\nDecember 31, 2020 Projected GAAP net income $53 to $84 Adjustments: Accretion of environmental liabilities 11 to 10 Depreciation and amortization 295 to 285 Other expense, net 3 to 3 Loss on sale of businesses 3 to 3 Interest expense, net 74 to 73 Provision for income taxes 31 to 42 Projected Adjusted EBITDA $470 to $500\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow Guidance Reconciliation\n\nAn itemized reconciliation between projected net cash from operating activities and projected adjusted free cash flow is as follows (in millions):\n\nFor the Year Ending\n\nDecember 31, 2020 Projected net cash from operating activities $355 to $405 Additions to property, plant and equipment (186) to (206) Purchase and capital improvements of corporate headquarters 21 to 21 Proceeds from sale and disposal of fixed assets 10 to 10 Projected adjusted free cash flow $200 to $230\n\nConference Call Information\n\nClean Harbors will conduct a conference call for investors today at 9:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss the information contained in this press release.

issued a statement to \u201caddress any potential speculation\u201d, saying it is already on top of the situation.\n\nDesigned, developed and manufactured in Derby, the TrentXWB-84 is the lower thrust version of the Trent XWB and powers the Airbus A350 aircraft.\n\nBilled as the world\u2019s most efficient in-service large civil aero engine, many of the first Trent XWBs to enter service are now approaching their first scheduled \u201cshop visits\u201d.\n\nHowever, during routine inspections as part of these scheduled shop visits, Rolls-Royce said it had identified indications of wear in the IPC of a \u201csmall number of engines\u201d that have been in service for four to five years and are approaching their first overhaul.\n\n(Image: Rolls-Royce plc)\n\nThe company said that none of these engines had experienced any abnormal in-flight operation. But Rolls-Royce said it was inspecting all other Trent XWB-84 engines of a similar service life as a precaution.\n\nThe company said that it would address the wear issues during existing shop visits and because it already has the necessary parts, it said it did not expect this issue to create significant customer disruption or material annual cost.\n\nThere are currently more than 100 Trent XWB-84s that have been in service for four to five years.\n\nRolls-Royce said it had inspected the majority of them and found signs of wear on an average of \u201conly one or two\u201d IPC blades in a minority of those inspected.\n\nOur email newsletter is the best way to stay informed with the latest headlines You can get the latest Derbyshire Live headlines straight to your inbox by subscribing to our newsletter.

Mark Kauzlarich | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nUber and Lyft are running out of options in California. The companies have been fighting to continue classifying their drivers as independent workers, avoiding expenses like healthcare and unemployment insurance for hundreds of thousands of drivers in the state. Last year, they failed to block a bill aimed at classifying gig workers as employees from becoming state law, and then, as of Monday, failed to convince a court the law should not apply to them. Now, while pledging to appeal the court's ruling on a preliminary injunction requiring them to reclassify drivers, Uber and Lyft are turning to voters as a last resort. On Wednesday, executives at both companies raised the stakes by threatening to suspend service in California if they can't get their way. Both stated in court filings that outcome would be practically inevitable in order to restructure their operations if enforcement of the injunction isn't further postponed. The companies would likely come back eventually, but it could take until at least November when voters decide their fate at the polls. Uber and Lyft have each poured $30 million into a ballot measure called Proposition 22, which would exempt drivers for app-based ride-hailing and food delivery services from the employee classification required under the new state law, Assembly Bill 5 (AB5). That's a risky move for the money-losing ride-hailing companies whose revenue has suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. On the one hand, Uber and Lyft may stand to gain from a temporary shutdown if voters realize how much they miss their services by November and vote yes on the proposition. With ridership already down, the companies won't miss out on their usual revenue, anyway. On the other hand, Californians who are already fed up with corporate tactics, and have a newfound appreciation for workers laboring through the pandemic, may decide Uber and Lyft should just follow the law as written. Riders and drivers could direct their anger toward the companies if they view them as abandoning the state in the midst of crisis. Analysts already see drivers as one of the biggest obstacles keeping Uber and Lyft from reaching profitability. If voters decide the companies should compensate workers as employees and become subject to other employer costs like payroll taxes, Uber and Lyft will have to rethink their entire business models or be forced to leave the biggest state in the country. Uber and Lyft did not provide statements directly on this article but pointed to court filings asking a judge to delay the reclassification for at least the extent of their appeal. The trial judge rejected that request, leaving the companies with about a week left on the stay unless the appellate court says otherwise. Uber also pointed to a past statement on the preliminary injunction and blog posts about the likely impact of the reclassification. Lyft pointed to an email it sent to drivers Thursday outlining similar points as well as comments by drivers advocating for voters to support the ballot measure to help them maintain flexible work hours.\n\nDriver preference\n\nWhen challenged over their classification of drivers as contractors, the first line of defense Uber and Lyft often invoke is that drivers prefer it that way. A 2020 survey of 734 app-based drivers conducted by the independent blog the Rideshare Guy found that more than 71% preferred being classified as independent workers. That's high, but not as high as a survey the same blog conducted prior to the pandemic, when more than 81% of the nearly 1,000 respondents said they preferred to be independent workers. But critics, including Silicon Valley Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., say drivers really want the flexibility that Uber and Lyft have unfairly claimed would be diminished under an employee model.\n\nwatch now\n\n\"The reality is that you can be a part-time driver and still be an employee. You can have flexibility and still be an employee,\" Khanna said in a phone interview Thursday. \"There's no justification for not treating these drivers as employees.\" In the earlier Rideshare Guy survey, pay and flexibility were most important to drivers. But labor experts say there's no reason flexibility and employment status should be diametrically opposed. \"They kind of use this rhetoric to create a zero sum equation,\" said Erin Hatton, a sociology professor at the University of Buffalo who has studied labor and the gig economy. \"We can construct all sorts of jobs to give workers more autonomy in the workplace. You don't have to be an independent contractor to do so. You don't have to be an independent contractor to have some flexibility in hours that you work. They're using this rhetoric to really kind of skirt unemployment law and decrease their obligation to workers and to the state.\" While Uber and Lyft provide a way for workers to earn extra cash on their own schedule, Hatton said it doesn't afford the level of freedom many initially expect. \"Yes, many workers do crave to be entrepreneurs, and they may very well be lured by the promise of that, but what we tend to see is that over time, they realize that that is sort of a false promise,\" she said. \"In order to support families, these jobs don't actually offer the control and autonomy and decent wages they seem to promise.\" When Nicole Moore began driving for Lyft a couple nights a week, she began to incur additional costs, like replacement tires and insurance for her now high-mileage car. \"The cash in your pocket is not what you're actually making,\" said Moore, who's an activist with Rideshare Drivers United, which has pushed for Uber and Lyft to reclassify drivers. Uber and Lyft have said reclassifying drivers as employees would place a large burden on their operations and therefore limit their ability to provide drivers with the same flexible schedules they do now. The ballot measure Lyft and Uber are supporting would entitle workers to some protections like healthcare subsidies, vehicle insurance and minimum earnings. In arguments before the court prior to the injunction, Lyft's lawyer said the protections under Proposition 22 do not place the same burden on businesses as employment status because the latter requires huge administrative changes including processing employment documents, hiring human resources staff, and implementing a system to manage and track hours worked. \"Employment status is not just ... about how much you pay people;\" the lawyer said, according to a court transcript, \"employment status has enormous regulatory regimes, state and federal, that requires all kinds of administrative things that Prop 22 does not require.\" An Uber spokesperson pointed to a May blog post where the company said reclassification \"would put pressure on Uber to consolidate working hours across fewer workers in order to manage costs that are fixed per employee. Under an employment model, it is likely that the new norm for Uber drivers would conform with the 40-hour work week which is the standard for full time U.S. employees.\" Across the state, Uber estimated, the number of active drivers per quarter would fall from 209,000 to 51,000, with the greatest impact on less urban markets that have fewer transportation alternatives. A Lyft spokesperson shared an email sent to drivers Thursday that said Lyft would aim to hire 10-20% of current California drivers if forced to comply with AB5. It would likely preference full-time workers over the 80% of drivers it said work fewer than 20 hours a week. Lyft told drivers it would likely need to plan their hours in advance and cap earnings at a set hourly wage, rather than allow them to choose more lucrative rides as they can under the current model. But this reasoning does not directly address one of the biggest draws for many drivers to Uber and Lyft's services, which is the ability to choose their hours and work as much or as little as they want. The companies would still likely face pressure from these drivers to maintain some level of flexibility in their service or lose out on a large potential workforce. \"Many many of us need and count on the flexibility. I don't know a driver that doesn't see the flexibility as one of the reasons they work in rideshare,\" Moore said. \"If they were to change that, many, many drivers would leave because [if] that's what we want is flexibility, we would find another industry that provided us the flexibility we need. They know that.\"\n\nA 'third way'?\n\nUber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has also turned to the federal government to try to solve his predicament in California. In a letter to President Donald Trump and conversations with members of Congress, Khosrowshahi has encouraged the formation of a \"third way\" to classify workers to be built into labor laws. In a New York Times op-ed published prior to the court's ruling on the preliminary injunction, Khosrowshahi elaborated on that idea, saying gig companies could pay into a fund available to independent workers for healthcare and paid time off commensurate with their hours worked.\n\nwatch now\n\nKhanna and the academics interviewed for this article said current labor law does not prevent Uber from providing such benefits while offering flexible hours under as an employer. \"I do not see why they would suddenly have to impose work schedules on workers or mandatory work times,\" said Hatton, the University of Buffalo professor. \"And the fact of the matter is, so many of these gig companies are already kind of controlling the time that their workers work in different ways indirectly.\" Alternatively, she said, it could be a reason to consider decoupling healthcare from all employers, which could help lift a heavy payment burden. Following publication of this article, an Uber spokesperson pointed to a blog post published Friday explaining why it believes it won't be able to offer the same level of flexibility to drivers as an employer. It gave the example of other service industry workers, like a barista or restaurant server, saying that while their employers are already allowed to provide workers with more flexible hours, they don't because it would be too difficult to complete the work. In the example of a restaurant, Uber wrote, \"anytime their employees decided to be on-shift, they would have to be paid, whether they had any work to do or the restaurant was closed. Why should anyone believe this same logic wouldn't also apply to companies like Uber?\" As an employer, Uber said, its incentives would be to limit the number of workers it hires to get the most out of their time without allowing them to work overtime, which it said would have the greatest impact on part-time drivers.\n\nPitting workers against everyone else\n\nDara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, appears on CNBC's Squawk Box at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan,. 22nd, 2020. Adam Galici | CNBC\n\nFor Uber and Lyft to be successful in November, they must convince consumers of their threats of higher prices and limited service if forced to comply with California labor law. \"What businesses often do is they pit workers against everyone else and they insist that if we have to pay them a penny more that will be translated into more costs for consumers,\" Hatton said. \"They drive this wedge between workers on the one hand and consumers on the other hand. But the truth of the matter is, workers and consumers are one and the same. There is no wedge between them. They are the same people. And so more money in their pockets always helps the economy.\" Companies have taken a similar tactic in fighting minimum wage laws, arguing they would be so burdensome they'd have to scale back. \"By and large companies have not been successful in saying our business model is new and successful and therefore we shouldn't have to pay the minimum wage or comply with OSHA,\" said University of Michigan business professor Erik Gordon, referring to worker safety protections provided by the Occupational Safety and Health Act. A 2019 review of available research on the minimum wage across the U.S., U.K. and other developed nations, a University of Massachusetts Amherst economist found minimal impact on employment when wages were raised. Still, there are legitimate fears consumers may have about Uber and Lyft pulling out of the state. Even if they were to simply scale back, Uber's CEO already indicated more sparsely populated areas would likely feel the greatest effects, leaving them with few other options. But Khanna is unconcerned that consumers will be left stranded, saying Uber and Lyft were telling \"bluffs\" and said \"Californians don't respond well to threats.\" He gave the example of Tesla CEO Elon Musk threatening to relocate its headquarters from California earlier this year while fighting local officials over reopening its factory during Covid-19 shutdown measures. \"They care very deeply about workers,\" Khanna said of Californians. Even if Uber and Lyft follow through, as they insist in court filings they would almost certainly have to, Gordon said a permanent retreat would be untenable. \"I think at that point their shareholders say, 'Actually, we need a new CEO. There is no way we are giving up California,'\" he said. \"Did the car companies give up California when California imposed its special pollution requirements on cars? No, because you can't give up the California market.\" Wherever Uber and Lyft pull back in California, Khanna said it would simply create room for a new competitor. \"If they can't figure it out, I'm confident other entrepreneurs will,\" he said. \"I think it would be foolish for these companies to give up their market share if that's the way they go, but that's their choice.\" Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

[Operator Instructions]\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Daniel Harris. Sir, please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Harris -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning and welcome to TCG BDC's second quarter 2020 earnings call. Last night, we issued an earnings press release and detailed earnings presentation with our quarterly results, a copy of which is available on TCG BDC's Investor Relations website. Following our remarks today, we will hold a question-and-answer session for analysts and institutional investors. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website. Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance, and undue reliance should not be placed on them. These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factor section on our annual report on Form 10-K that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. TCG BDC assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements at any time.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Linda Pace.\n\nLinda Pace -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our call this morning to discuss our second quarter 2020 results. Joining me on the call today is our Chief Investment Officer, Taylor Boswell; and our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Hennigan.\n\nI'd like to focus my remarks today across three areas. First, highlighting the positive momentum in our business under our new leadership team. Second, a quick review of our quarterly results. And third, a discussion of our updated dividend policy. Let me start by looking at the positive momentum we'll get established on behalf of shareholders over the past year. Our priority is to deliver sustainable income generation and an attractive risk adjusted return for shareholders, which we strive to accomplish through portfolio construction, differentiated origination, and prudent management of our capital.\n\nOur portfolio construction strategy continues to focus on firstly loans in a diversified group of sectors we know well. We largely avoid highly cyclical sectors like energy and retail, and instead stick to our knitting in areas like high tech and software, business and financial services, and healthcare and pharmaceutical. Our true first lien exposure is just about 70% of our portfolio, generally in line with our historical average. But we remain opportunistic across the capital stack, we believe we are being compensated for that additional risk.\n\nWe continue to improve our leadership position in the marketplace, and our influence has substantially increased as our platform has scaled and matured over the past few years. Today, we have a lead role in about 90% of our transactions. This increased leadership role accrues to the benefit of TCG BDC and our shareholders. We have strengthened and diversified our origination footprint. While our core investment exposure remains domestic sponsored back leveraged loans, we now also regularly make investments outside the US in specialty strategies, such as asset base and recurring revenue lending and increasingly, we invest alongside other Carlyle Global Credit vehicles to amplify the benefits of our scale.\n\nAnd finally, we actively manage our liabilities to ensure we can continue delivering results for all of our stakeholders. At the end of 2019, we priced our first unsecured bond transaction, which has been incredibly helpful during recent market volatility. In addition, we took decisive action early in the second quarter to reestablish our target leverage range, and we are now back comfortably inside our target leverage range of 1 to 1.4 times. Overall, we are operating well in a difficult market, and I'm extremely proud of the hard work across our entire team.\n\nLet me move onto an overview results for the quarter. We generated net investment income of $0.38 per share, a strong result given the significant interest rate headwinds across the entire industry and lower than trend origination activity. Net asset value per share increased 4.4% quarter-over-quarter to $14.80 from $14.18. Last quarter, nearly two-thirds of our unrealized loss was due to spread widening of market yield benchmarks. This quarter, market yields rebounded, resulting in an overall positive impact on valuations and a partial recapture of last quarters' unrealized loss.\n\nFinally, let me shift to discussion of our dividend. Our focus remains generating a sustainable income stream, which delivers an attractive dividend for our shareholders. Given ongoing economic uncertainty and a dramatically different interest rate environment as compared to past periods, we have chosen to update our dividend policy. Our new policy aims to deliver a highly secure regular dividend of $0.32, which we intend to supplement each quarter with additional special dividends based on actual earnings. We believe this new regular dividend is highly sustainable, even under downside economic scenarios, and for reference alone generates an annualized dividend yield on our current stock price of approximately 15%.\n\nUnder our new policy, in the third quarter, we declared a total dividend of $0.37 per share, which is in line with our historical regular dividend, and which is comprised of the new regular quarterly dividend of $0.32, plus a special dividend of $0.05. We believe that CGBD's market leading origination platform, strong underwriting capabilities, conservative portfolio construction and prudent liability management will drive solid operating results. And over time, our share price should ultimately better reflect the strength of our platform. I'd like to thank each of you for your time and partnership.\n\nAnd let me now, hand the call over to our Chief Investment Officer, Taylor Boswell.\n\nTaylor Boswell -- Chief Investment Officer\n\nThank you, Linda. Since our last report in May, the global economy has taken its first steps toward recovery. Carlyle's view is that this recovery will be unpredictable in slope and duration, as well as uneven across geographies and sectors. Signs of rebounding economic activity, particularly in China and Europe are encouraging. While the potential for lingering weakness in areas where virus containment has been more challenged, like the US, weigh on our view. Away from COVID, increasing tensions between the US and China, as well as the pending presidential election, interject additional risks.\n\nThe continuing macro uncertainty leads us to maintain a cautious perspective on the outlook for the real economy and markets. Over the same time, leveraged finance market conditions continued an impressive rebound, with secondary levels rallying alongside equities and other risk assets on government stimulus, better than feared macro data, progress toward vaccines and economic reopening.\n\nThat said, away from the high yield market, which is benefiting from strong technical demands, primary deal volumes were relatively light in Q2, due to the aforementioned uncertainty and a broad based slowing of M&A activity. However, the last eight weeks have begun to evidence a noticeable uptick, as market participants gain more confidence in a path to post-COVID normalization. While marketwide activity levels remain short of the robust pre-COVID period, our platforms sourcing advantages are creating sustained deal flow. In our core markets, we are generally seeing a combination of higher yields, lower leverage, and improved documentation. In addition, transactions are concentrating in sectors relatively unaffected by COVID, like technology and B2B commerce, further improving risk reward. Finally, while there remains meaningful competition, it is relatively less intense than in past periods.\n\nAll in all, we regard this new investment environment as attractive, and one in which the resources of and insights available from our broad platform offer meaningful benefits. As such, we have been actively evaluating new investments in recent funds. CGBD closed four significant deals in the quarter, two of which were pre-COVID commitments, and two of which were entirely new transactions. And we will continue to selectively deploy capital into this undeniably complex, but compelling investment environment.\n\nTurning now to the portfolio. At this point, having the benefit of four months of intense engagement, it is fair to say that performance is tracking ahead of our prior expectations. The liquidity needs of our borrowers have been less than anticipated. We have seen a reversal in calls and unfunded commitments, and we place only one additional borrower on non-accrual this quarter. In May, we discussed how we anticipate levered credit portfolios will move through three stages this cycle, an initial liquidity draw, followed by a significant amount of amendment activity, and ultimately, the longer-term work of value recovery and maximization for more heavily impacted businesses. CGBD navigated the first stage extremely well, owing to our diverse, well-constructed liability structure.\n\nWe're now in the midst of that second stage, and we feel equally well positioned. We are finding financial sponsor partners to largely be supportive of portfolio companies, while management teams are enacting impressive change in response to this difficult environment. In amendment conversations, we generally feel that fair exchanges are being conducted, with lenders receiving risk reduction or incremental return when granting relief to borrowers, always with an eye toward preserving value of the underlying company.\n\nThis amendment activity began in late March, will peak in the coming weeks with the formal delivery of Q2 financials, and should be largely completed by year-end 2020. Given the excellent work of our team into and through this crisis, our significant roles in these transactions, as well as the depth of partnership we have with the management teams and owners of our portfolio companies, we feel we have a high level of visibility into which portions of the portfolio will require relief. And are increasingly confident that the vast majority of those borrowers will ultimately present little risk of principal loss for CGBD.\n\nThat said, significant risk remains both in the macro environment and within pockets of our own exposures. In order to better communicate portfolio risk, we made the decision this quarter to update our risk rating methodology. The prior methodology's heavy tie to trailing 12-month financial performance came up short and communicating shifting risk, as reporting would have lagged in this rapidly evolving cycle. Our new methodology, which more appropriately weighs qualitative, quantitative and transaction dynamics, allows us to report earlier with more clarity and transparency, what we know about current and prospective performance.\n\nYou will see under the new method that deals rated 3 to 5 account for approximately 30% of loan portfolio fair value. To be clear, we expect the preponderance of borrowers rated 3 or below will perform through this cycle. Within this group, our value maximization efforts are particularly focused in the hotel gaming and leisure, food and beverage, and aerospace and defense sectors, which collectively represent one-third of risk rated 3 to 5 borrowers. Across all of our risk rated 3 to 5 borrowers, 85% of fair value are first dollar exposures, nearly all of which are covenanted. Meanwhile, the 15% of our risk rated 3 to 5 loans and second lien investments is invested in high-quality issuers, averaging over $150 million of EBITDA with significant liquidity runways. We believe both profiles provide a very favorable backdrop to support ultimate realized performance.\n\nPutting all this in the context of our depressed stock trading valuation, for NAV to decrease the levels approximating CGBD's recent share price, future losses would need to equate to over 70% of the fair value of our entire risk rated 3 to 5 loan portfolio. Needless to say, given the senior positioning of our portfolio and its current performance trends, we think this is highly improbable. In fact, we firmly believe our current asset valuations are prudent and appropriately reflect our portfolio's value. While we cannot predict with precision, the amount and timing of value recovery or loss realization, we are confident that our portfolio will perform through the cycle, both in terms of NAV preservation and delivery against our revised dividend policy. We look forward to demonstrating the same to each of our constituencies, and appreciate all their support and confidence.\n\nThank you again for your time. I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Tom Hennigan.\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nThank you, Taylor. Today, I'll begin with a review of our second quarter earnings, then drill deeper into valuations and our balance sheet positioning. As Linda previewed, we had another solid quarter of total income generation, particularly given the macroeconomic backdrop. Total investment income for the second quarter was $45 million, down from $51 million in the prior quarter. The decrease was driven by a few factors. First, interest income on the core investment book was down from $39 million to $35 million, driven by the combination of lower LIBOR and lower average invested loan balance.\n\nSecond, OID accretions fell by almost $1 million this quarter, given we had zero non-scheduled loan repayments. And third, total income at the JV was about $1 million lower compared to first quarter, primarily due to running the vehicle at lower leverage.\n\nOne offset to these top line headwinds was an increase in total fee income, driven primarily by higher amendment related fees. Total expenses were $24 million in the quarter, down from $27 million last quarter. The largest component of the decrease was interest expense due to lower LIBOR, with management and incentive fees also lower compared to first quarter. This resulted in net investment income for the quarter of $21 million or $0.38 per common share, which is below our historical trend line, but we think a solid result given the overall market backdrop. As Linda noted, we do see some pressure on this level going forward, driven primarily by some of the market factors that impacted second quarter results, including the sharp drop in LIBOR, lower income streams tied to M&A refinancing activity, and opting to run both the BDC and our JV at lower leverage.\n\nBased on a rigorous sensitivity analysis of these and other factors, including potential future non-accruals related to COVID-19, we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver an attractive sustained dividend. We intend to do so by not just meeting the new $0.32 regular dividend, but also consistently beating that level, resulting in special dividends each quarter that will be sized based on the prior quarter's actual earnings. On August 3, our Board of Directors declared the dividend for the third quarter of 2020 at a total level of $0.37 per share, and that's payable to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 30.\n\nMoving onto the JV's performance, the dividend yield on our equity was about 10% in the second quarter. This is consistent with the 9% to 11% expected range we mentioned during last quarter's call, despite our decision to run at lower leverage. Onto evaluations, our total aggregate realized and unrealized net gain was $34 million for the quarter. Big picture, we saw valuations increase, based on the rebound and broader market yields. This was partially offset by negative fundamentals from the impact of COVID-19 on some investments. I'm going to bucket our portfolio into a few categories. The first is performing lower COVID impacted names, and I'm including our equity investment in the JV in this category, given the strength of that portfolio. This bucket accounts for about 70% of fair value as of 6\/30. Based primarily on the rebound and market yields, these investments increased in value $40 million compared to 3\/31.\n\nThe next category is our historically underperforming names, some of which have COVID exposure. We actually experienced a $6 million increase in this category, aided by some stabilizing to improving business trends, and a handful of favorable amendments, which included sponsors supporting these businesses with incremental equity. The final category is the moderate to heavier COVID impacted names. Some of these have more severely disrupted business models, as we look at both near-term performance and longer-term prospects. Given the uncertainty at this stage of the cycle and pandemic, we attempted to be appropriately conservative in our assessment of these names, which resulted in a $12 million markdown across these investments.\n\nYou'll note the sizable realized loss of $48 million. This was primarily driven by the exit of our investments in Dimensional Dental, a loss -- we previously marked it close to zero, so this realized loss is a reversal of prior period unrealized loss. The balance was from our secondary sales efforts, which we touched on during last quarter's call. From a non-accrual perspective, we added one new borrower while exiting another, so total borrowers on non-accrual status remained at five. As of 6\/30, non-accruals stood at 3.7% of fair value, and 6% based on cost.\n\nI'll finish with a review of our financing facilities and liquidity. Total debt outstanding was about $1 billion at quarter end, down $227 million from prior quarter. Statutory leverage improved from 1.6 times to 1.3. times, and more importantly, net financial leverage, which assumes that preferred is converted was under 1.2 times. With this recent deleveraging, unused commitments under our credit facilities plus cash increased from about $320 million at prior quarter end to over $500 million as of 6\/30. During the second quarter, we did elect to pause our repurchase activity, with capital preservation a primary goal at the onset of the pandemic. With our improved liquidity position, going forward, we intend to pursue the appropriate balance of both share repurchases and attractive new investment opportunities.\n\nAnd while we're very comfortable with our current leverage and liquidity position, we continue to look for ways to improve our balance sheet flexibility. Given recent improvement in the rate environment for BDC issuers, we're evaluating various incremental financing solutions with a primary goal to further optimize our liability structure and provide additional flexibility as we navigate through this period of market uncertainty.\n\nOne final note, you'll see we filed a preliminary proxy for the ability to issue shares below NAV. We think this is prudent corporate finance policy, and provides us additional flexibility to defend the portfolio, primarily during periods of extreme market volatility. But given our current balance sheet positioning, we have no near-term need or intention to issue shares below NAV. So, we appreciate your support for these both.\n\nWith that, let me turn the call back over to Linda for some closing remarks.\n\nLinda Pace -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Tom. I'll finish where I started. We have significant momentum in our Company with a high quality, largely personally investment portfolio that is driving attractive investment income for our shareholders. We're strengthening our origination capabilities and fortifying our balance sheet. There's still work to be done, but TCG BDC is well positioned to successfully manage through the current environment. Thank you. We are now ready to take your questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nRick Shane -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. And I apologize. I know we can pull this out of the queue but what are the non-accruals at cost for the second quarter? We're actually having some data problems today. Could you compare that to the first quarter as well, please?\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nHey, Rick, it's Tom. The question was the percentage of non-accruals at cost?\n\nRick Shane -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\n\nYes.\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nIt was 6% on cost.\n\nRick Shane -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\n\nWhat was it at the first quarter? Again I'm having trouble accessing my normal resources. I apologize.\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nSure. It was up -- it was upper, here from -- on a cost basis, there was an uptick from first quarter, it was 5.4% on cost as of 3\/31.\n\nRick Shane -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\n\nOkay, great, thank you. And then look, I think rationalizing dividend policy in light of all the way the stock is trading and is valued makes a great deal of sense and give you some more flexibility. I am curious to hear the other part of that is investing in your own stock through repurchase. What's the outlook there and what's the appetite given the levels?\n\nLinda Pace -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nHi, Rick. It's Linda. Yeah. Good question. It's something that we're consistently looking at given, as you pointed out where our stock price is trading. We definitely think our stock is an excellent buy. So we evaluate that in an ongoing basis. We have about $14 million left on our share repurchase program, and we're likely to go back to the board to reup that. But what we want to do is there's still a lot of uncertainty so we do want to make sure that we're being balanced, and how we use our cash and how we protect our balance sheet. But as I said, we do think our stock is a pretty good buy but we don't want to get too far out over our skis. We like where our balance sheet is positioned, and there's still a lot of uncertainty in the market, so we do want to approach it pretty cautiously.\n\nRick Shane -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\n\nLook, it's a fair point. It's easy from this seat to say, buy the stock, buy the stock, it's cheap. But then as the world turns a little bit worse, you're going to wish you had that capital so we appreciate the balance on that. [Speech Overlap] Sorry, Linda, I interrupted. I apologize.\n\nLinda Pace -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nNo, no, I just want to say, yeah, no, thank you for that. Yeah, we're thinking the same way. So appreciate the question.\n\nRick Shane -- JP Morgan -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ryan Lynch with KBW. Your line is now open.\n\nRyan Lynch -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to have a follow-up question with the supplemental dividend. Do you guys have a framework for the intention of paying out that supplemental dividend going forward? Is that going to be basically 100% payout of operating earnings at 50% payout above your core dividend? Just any sort of framework that you guys have set to pay out those supplemental dividends going forward.\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nHey, Ryan, it's Tom. You'll see in particular as an example for this quarter, we size the $0.05 special based on effectively second quarter results. So paying out a majority of the excess above the $0.32 and we would anticipate doing the same going forward, effectively looking at the prior quarters' results and then paying out some supplemental size to our actual results.\n\nRyan Lynch -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nOkay.\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nWe anticipate the $0.32 we feel very comfortable with and we anticipate each quarter exceeding that level and paying a special amount will vary quarter-to-quarter.\n\nRyan Lynch -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nOkay, got it. Then you mentioned because of the payoffs and the increase in loan valuations, you guys are now back within your target leverage ratio of 1 to 1.4 times. Can you clarify -- you guys have a debt to equity at quarter end of 1.17 times and a statutory debt to equity of 1.31 times. Can you clarify, are you -- from your target of leverage range is that going to be used in your debt to equity metric or your statutory debt to equity metric?\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nRyan, it's something, we look at both and particularly as the market evolves, we'll be conscious of both in terms of obviously the flexibility that we have with that preferred equity tranche. But it's something that, right now, we're comfortably right in the middle of that range, really with both metrics, and something we'll continue to keep an eye on as the market evolves.\n\nRyan Lynch -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nOkay.\n\nTaylor Boswell -- Chief Investment Officer\n\nRyan, I might just emphasize the point there that when it comes to practically managing the balance sheet liquidity, leverage how definitions of leverage flow through our different facilities and the like, really that financial leverage concept is a more applicable concept for the day-to-day operation of the right side of our balance sheet but we, of course, are mindful of statutory as well.\n\nRyan Lynch -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nOkay, makes sense. You mentioned having some loan modifications as well as think those will actually pick up as more results come in. Can you just talk about so far, one, how many new loan modifications were made in the second quarter; and two, out of those loan modifications that were made how many of those cases was the private equity sponsor willing to come in and provide additional capital support in order to get those loan modifications? And what have those conversations been like as you guys are working through and all lenders are working through stress in their portfolios? What has been the dialogue with sponsors and their willingness and ability to support some of these companies that are challenged in this downturn?\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nHey Ryan, it's Tom. The -- I'd say that our level of amendment activity in the first -- in the second quarter was moderate and certainly picking up meaningfully here, in the third quarter, as we look at the second quarter covenants. And quite frankly that, most of our transactions have financial covenants. So quite a few borrowers dealing with second quarter breaches or anticipated breaches. So those are the amendments working on real-time.\n\nWhen we look at the amendments that were in the active quarter, year probe. When we look at the second quarter, you probably count on one hand in terms of the level of material amendments, but as I look across the board, three of the four material amendments included consisted of the sponsors injecting additional equity, and typically in exchange for us also getting additional rate, but in each of those cases, agreeing to some level of pick interest. Typically on a temporary period for the Company to get through COVID or through any temporary performance challenges. So in each of those cases, equity, covenant relief, additional economics, some of them form of pick, and then we'll call it interim pick relief for some of our interest. Those are pretty standard across the board for our material amendments.\n\nRyan Lynch -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nOkay, that's helpful commentary. And then just one last one. I think you said in your prepared remarks, as this quarter kind of played out, this feels like some of the performance of some of your companies has improved. The liquidity needs haven't been as large as you guys were initially expecting and so it feels like things are going tentatively heading in the right direction, although obviously we're still in a pretty good downturn with a pretty slow recovery. I'm just wondering when we look at your current level of non-accruals or defaults in your portfolio, do you expect that we've kind of hit peak levels at the end of this quarter? Or do you think that that will continue to trend higher going forward? Of course, knowing nobody really knows that outlook, but just based on the conversations you've had with your sponsors and liquidity needs of your companies today.\n\nTaylor Boswell -- Chief Investment Officer\n\nYeah. Hey, it's Taylor. I think what I would say is that -- let me approach it this way. All of our non-accruals, current non-accruals today are first dollar exposures and so we really feel pretty strongly about our ability to recover that capital and get that capital earning again over time. And so I think that there is a significant amount of confidence in preserving our earnings level generally. The harder thing to predict, as you know is whether or not in one quarter we might bump an additional non-accrual when another one isn't rolling off. So there's a little bit of unpredictability quarter-to-quarter I would say, but I think we're generally feeling like we're well accounted for in how we've established our new dividend and well accounted for in terms of the overall performance of the portfolio.\n\nSo I don't think we are anticipating material increases going forward and I think there's a pretty balanced profile when I look at the risk and opportunity in that line item of our P&L going forward. But there is uncertainty out there and so we want to be cautious about that topic, obviously.\n\nRyan Lynch -- KBW -- Analyst\n\nOkay, I understand, those are all my questions. I appreciate your time today.\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nThanks, Ryan.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Finian O'Shea with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nFinian O'Shea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nHi, good afternoon. Taylor, just the sort of segue on that line discussion with Ryan. I want to go back to your comments on this downturn in recovery. You said the initial phase was way less bad than it could have been and now we're sort of in the amendments phase which is going well and you expect that to end with June financials. What level of reunderwriting are you doing as you make these amendments? My concern here is are you sort of saying it's all over, because you've gotten through the worst and now you make an amendment. Given we don't really know what the new normal is going to look like for these financials. We've got through the bottom, but how do we know where earnings will be for these portfolio companies say next year? So any comments on how conservatively these are being reunderwritten as you recapitalize and amend and so forth your borrowers.\n\nTaylor Boswell -- Chief Investment Officer\n\nYeah. Hey, Fin, good morning. I think that the first point of context I put around that is for most of the businesses that are seeing COVID impact are not businesses that have gone to zero from a top-line perspective and remain at zero, there's a significant portion of those portions of our portfolio where we actually can see the rebounding earnings occurring currently and can see positive earnings developments. And so for those names, it is a relatively clear path, I think to understanding where normalized earnings will settle for those businesses. The level of reunderwriting we're engaged in there is perhaps not as deep and as focused as those names that are deeply impacted. We call that a couple of sectors where that deeply impacted activity is more concentrated in our prepared remarks.\n\nIn those businesses, I think we take our confidence from a couple of things. One is our senior positioning in the capital structure and generally, the amount of enterprise value behind us on a pre-COVID basis gives you a lot of room to absorb the detrimental actions around the value of the business through this crisis. I'd say as we approach the amendment conversations, you always have a choice of what to focus on. You can focus on risk reduction or return enhancement. In those names, we focus on risk reduction and making sure that businesses operate with enough liquidity, because I think the most severe outcomes for lenders tend to be businesses that are run liquidity starved for a long time. So we're really in a broad-based partnership in those severely affected businesses with the owners to bridge through to the other side of this crisis.\n\nAnd if it ends up being six months, nine months, 12 months, we've generally seen everybody in the boat rowing in the same direction to solve for that. And the last point I'd make is there is enough data even in most of the severely impacted businesses to start to understand curves. If it's a multi-unit business to understand unit-level profitability at different levels of demand to inform your valuation conversation and strike a view about where the balance of risk and rewards should strike that ultimate valuation.\n\nSo, kind of a long answer, Fin, because that is a complicated topic, and I guess maybe it would be zipped up in a -- we're just learning a lot. We're four months into this and constant conversations with everybody around the table. The data is coming back and if we can just refine and tighten with a tweak that passes then we feel better and better. Again, not out of the woods, but feel better and better.\n\nLinda Pace -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nHey, Fin, it's Linda. Maybe I just add to your point about reunderwriting. That really does tie into our decision to improve our risk rating methodology. I think like what COVID-19 really sort of brought to light was that we wanted to have a more risk rating policy that better incorporated our views going forward and even while still relies on historical performance. Especially in a time like this, it's really what do we think is going to happen in the future. And that's one of the reasons why we did do the revision. So, I think yes, we're still doing rigorous credit work but with definitely an emphasis on how do we view the names in our portfolios in light of the uncertainty that we're saying, and in light of the global health crisis that we're all going through. So if you wanted to point to something tangible, that reflects the question that you asked, I would point to our revised risk rating policy.\n\nFinian O'Shea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nSure. I actually, really am a fan of that and that was going to be part of my next question. Forgive me if you broke this out already but in the concept of reunderwriting or rating and valuing more forward-looking to reflect where you would do a loan today, looking at your overall portfolio was up, but the names that were down. is there a breakdown from your new rating system versus incremental, fundamental decline? I guess ballpark is it 50-50 or tilted one way or another for the group of names that saw a decline?\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nHey, Fin, it's Tom. I'd say it's difficult to put an exact number on that but there's certainly a correlation between deals that previously were risk rated 2. By the way, first quarter results may have still been pretty good in a lot of cases, but we know that the second quarter was going to be difficult and the Company may have headwinds going forward. That deal would potentially be a 3 under our new risk rating scale, and those more COVID impacted names, more likely to have a violation decline as of 6\/30 relative to 3\/31. Certainly the fact, correlation between COVID impacted deals, risk-rated 3 under the new system and deals with valuation declines, 3\/31 to 6\/30.\n\nFinian O'Shea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nGot it. Fair enough. Tom, last question for you. Appreciating your color on the MMCF earnings. I believe last quarter you said that this quarter, next quarter would be trough earnings for the MMCF. Correct me if I'm wrong there. But is there any -- I think those CLOs are static in there too. So it would keep declining if you don't ramp it in another way. But is that still the case? Do you have a more short term and medium term outlook for the leverage profile and therefore, earnings profile of the MMCF?\n\nThomas Hennigan -- Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer\n\nSure. Fin, I'm not sure if I classified it as trough but more given an expected range that was a bit lower than we had historically. Historically, we've been more mid teens and last quarter and as we see it today, still expectation of about 9% to 11%. That's how dividend pays for the second quarter and that's what we see. We'll call it normalized earnings right now. If you look at that table book, it's performing very well. It has relatively light COVID impact. It's one that right now, given the market uncertainty. We plan to stay the course, keep leveraging more than it's been historically. We anticipate in the near term at the same relatively consistent 9% to 11% clip for that vehicle.\n\nFinian O'Shea -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\n\nOkay, appreciate the color. And thanks, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks.\n\nDaniel Harris -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you very much for all your time this morning.

And welcome to Azul's Second Quarter 2020 Results Conference Call. My name is Greg, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]\n\nI would like to turn the presentation over to Andrea Bottcher, Investor Relations Manager. Please proceed.\n\nAndrea Bottcher -- Manager of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Greg and welcome all to Azul's second quarter earnings call. The results that we announced this morning, the audio of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available on our IR website. Presenting today will be David Neeleman, Azul's Founder and Chairman; and John Rodgerson, CEO; Alex Malfitani, our CFO; and Abhi Shah, our Chief Revenue Officer are also here for the Q&A session.\n\nBefore I turn the call over to David, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives, and expected performance constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a range of assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to uncertainties and risks that are discussed in detail in our CVM and SEC filings.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David. David?\n\nDavid Gary Neeleman -- Founder and Chairman\n\nThank you, Andrea. Hello everybody, thank you for joining us on our second-quarter earnings call. The second quarter was without a doubt the most challenging time in aviation history and our team has done an incredible job taking care of our customers, manage our costs, improve -- and most importantly, preserving our liquidity. I'm very thankful for the sacrifices they are making for Azul.\n\nOur mission is to provide our crewmembers the best jobs of their lives and our customers with the best flight to their lives. I'm happy to report that last month Azul was elected the best airline in the world in the 2020 TripAdvisor Travelers Choice Awards. This is an incredible achievement and a strong testament to our crewmember's dedication and passion in taking care of our customers on every single flight on every single day. As you can see from Slide 3, we are on top of some great airlines in the world.\n\nMoving on to the next slide. On the operational side, we have implemented a lot of actions to guarantee the safety and sustainability of our business. We are the first airline in Brazil to introduce daily temperature checks for all of our crewmembers and mandatory -- mandatory mask requirement for customers and crew members on every flight. Our jets are fitted with state-of-the-art HEPA filters that remove at least 99% of the airborne particles. We have also implemented an innovative boarding passes called Tapete Azul or blue carpet, where projectors create a moving carpet image on the floor, guiding our customers to board when the specific seats are called.\n\nOn average this process reduces boarding times by 25%, while increasing NPS by 21%. By the end of the year, we expect to have this system adopted on 70% of our flights. Moving on to Slide 5, we're rebuilding our network. We operated only 7 -- 70 daily flights in April, but in September, we expect to operate over 400. Azul's fleet flexibility is like no other airline in Brazil or probably the world.\n\nWe have aircraft ranging from nine seats to 214 seats, which allows us to customize our network according to the demand using the right aircraft for the right flight. During times of uncertain demand, the best thing to do is to bring in that demand at the lowest possible trip cost. This is exactly what we are doing as we rebuild the network step by step. As demand recovers, we will have more options to create our network faster and at a lower cost than airlines that fly a larger single type aircraft. It is simply not economical to fly a large plane in markets that don't have enough revenue to cover the trip cost.\n\nAbhi is building schedules on a weekly basis, which allows him to constantly test demand, swap that out aircraft at different times. So if we can fill in A320, we fly in A320. We can only fill an Embraer, we fly that. And if we only have an ATRs worth of demand that's what we fly. Another way Azul is fortunate is that we've been receiving support from our stakeholders, including crew members, aircraft manufacturers, lessors, banks, suppliers and the Brazilian government. We have developed a management plan that includes a contribution from all of our stakeholders and I am confident that we will come out of this crisis stronger.\n\nI have created many businesses in airlines over the years. It's all about people and relationships. I can tell you we have the best people in the business. Everyone on this call is an owner and the founder of the best airline in the world. I'm confident that we'll get through this.\n\nWith that, I'll pass the word on to John and he will give you more details about our results and our response to the crisis. Take it away, John.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, David. Hello, everyone and thanks for joining us today. I couldn't agree more with David, we have a great team. I'm very thankful for their dedication and I'm proud of how together we have been able to successfully navigate through these unprecedented times.\n\nDuring the second quarter, our main focus was to preserve our financial liquidity and reduce fixed costs. Thanks to our fast reaction, we were able to end the second quarter with a higher cash position than in the first quarter. An achievement that not many airlines in the world were able to report. We expect to have a net cash burn of only BRL$3 million a day in the second half of the year and as you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have already negotiated the rollover of all relevant debt repayment in the second half of the year.\n\nAs you can see on Slide 7, we ended the quarter with significant sources of liquidity in unencumbered assets totaling BRL6.6 billion. We have no restricted cash. We also have our loyalty program TudoAzul which can sell points in advance and is wholly owned and unencumbered.\n\nWe reached an agreement with the Portuguese Government that was approved overwhelmingly by our minority shareholders this week to withdraw our conversion rates of the TAP bond in exchange for the financial support of EUR1.2 billion to the airlines. That puts the current value of our TAP investment at BRL754 million, equivalent to BRL689 million in principal, plus accrued interest and BRL65 million for the sale of our equity participation.\n\nWe feel confident that with the aid provided by the Portuguese Government, TAP will come out of this crisis, and that our investment will continue to be protected. As a reminder, we will maintain our status as a senior creditor at an annual interest rate of 7.5% and collateral including a lien on TAP's loyalty program. Our commercial relationship with TAP also remains intact.\n\nDuring our last earnings call, we presented the management plan to maintain the liquidity required to confront this crisis and optimize the airline for the future. The management plan counts with the support of all our stakeholders, including crewmembers, lessors, aircraft manufacturers, suppliers, and the Brazilian government. I'm happy to report that the implementation of the management plan has already generated over BRL7 billion in working capital savings until December of 2021 resulting from the negotiations on several fronts, you can see on Slide 9.\n\nWe negotiate with labor unions to bring flexibility to our operation and job protection for many of our crewmembers. We also implemented other initiatives including voluntary programs and involuntary furloughs, resulting in a projected salary expense reduction of 40% in the second half of the year compared to pre-COVID levels, a key component of our fixed cost reduction.\n\nWe continue to make progress in negotiations with our financial partners and expect to roll over all of our short-term debt, amortization as it becomes due with already rolled over all Q3 and Q4 payments. In addition to the deferral of 59 Embraer aircraft announced in May, we also negotiated with Airbus to deferral of 23 aircraft to 2024 and beyond.\n\nWe've negotiated with Breeze Aviation to take delivery of 12 E-Jets over the next 18 months, including three still this year. In August, we concluded the sale of two E1s generating additional cash after paying off the debt associated with these aircraft. We will also -- we were also able to accelerate the exit of three E-Jets this year, previously scheduled to exit the fleet in 2021. We successfully negotiated aircraft lease terms, resulting in BRL3.2 billion of working capital reduction as demonstrated on Slide 10.\n\nAs a result of the new lease agreements, we will follow an adjusted payment schedule based on a conservative demand recovery projection. As you can see on the left side of the slide, this is a much better than a power-by-the-hour structure because there is a buffer between the demand recovery projection and the rent payment schedule.\n\nWe also keep the upside if the recovery happens faster than expected, which is currently happening in Brazil. This new payment profile gives us BRL3.2 billion in working capital relief until December of next year. In addition, as a result of the successful negotiations with our lessors, our lease liabilities are expected to decrease BRL3.4 billion from the end of March to December reaching BRL12.5 billion by the end of the year, reflecting the present value of the newly negotiated lease payment under IFRS. This is an increase in equity value for the company.\n\nMoving on to Slide 11, as demand recovers, we continue to rebuild our network. We remain true to our network strategy by being the only carrier in over 80% of the markets we serve and by maximizing passenger connectivity through our main hubs in Campinas, Belo and Recife. In June, we signed a historical codeshare agreement with Latam increasing, even more, the capillarity of our network, reducing market risks and benefiting customers from both airlines.\n\nThis is truly one of a kind of partnership agreement in terms of scale and connectivity. We started selling tickets yesterday and we look forward to offering the best travel network service and options to our customers. We've been carefully monitoring the demand recovery to gradually increase our network in schedules. By September, we expect to offer over 400 daily flights as David mentioned, representing 43% of last year's total ASKs.\n\nBy December, we expect to reach 60% of last year's total demand as we continue to see a positive trend in the demand recovery. It's important to highlight that we only operate flights that generate enough revenue to comfortably cover its variable cost. This is why having a flexible fleet with aircraft that have lower trip cost is a key in this current environment.\n\nA couple of years ago, we invested heavily in our cargo business and now we can clearly see this investment has paid off. Azul Cargo continues to present an outstanding performance with the second quarter 2020 revenues essentially flat compared to the same period last year even with the dramatic reduction in the size of our network. Since then, the performance has been even better. And we've been able to increase our cargo revenue once again.\n\nIn July, for example, revenue increased 48% year-over-year. Most of this growth was -- growth was driven by broad expansion in all segments of the cargo market especially our e-commerce logistics business, which represents just about 20% of our cargo revenue in the second quarter. Given the fleet flexibility, breadth and connectivity of our network, we are uniquely positioned to take full advantage of the rising commerce demand. Every asset we hold is available to our cargo team.\n\nIn summary, we had three major objectives since we talked to you last. First, react to the immediate crisis by preserving cash; second, implement the Azul management plan, which now gives us more than 24 months of liquidity by raising BRL7 billion in working capital through our stakeholders; and third, create market opportunities, such as our cargo e-commerce solution and the codeshare with Latam, which further allows us to develop our unique business model.\n\nNow our focus is in utilizing our entire tool kit to bringing back our network in a safe and responsible way. Crisis brings opportunities and we are clearly taking advantage of the period we are now facing to search new opportunities.\n\nWith that David, Alex and I will answer any of your questions as I turn the call over to the operator.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Josh Milberg with Morgan Stanley.\n\nJosh Milberg -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nHey, everyone. Thank you very much for the call and the opportunity to raise some questions. My first -- the first question I wanted to ask about your lessors agreement, Alex had suggested to us some time ago that you'd have this NPV benefits from the late payments, that the nominal lease amounts would be honored and I just wanted to check if that is, in fact, the case or if there was some haircut? And then a related question is whether there was or will be a change in the discount rate used to calculate that the liability?\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nSure, Josh. Thanks for the question. Yeah. So I think the majority of the benefit comes from the reprofiling, but there were discounts and haircuts, right, but would -- like it's kind of in the -- low to mid-single digits across the whole lease liability. It was a big discount on some aircraft, but kind of diluted across the whole fleet we're talking about kind of low to mid-single digits. So the vast majority of the NPV benefit comes from the reprofile. IFRS requires you to use our discount rate, right. And I think there is opportunity for the standard to be improved.\n\nI don't know if it's the ideal way to do it, but yes, there is the benefit from the reprofiling for sure. Obviously, if you keep the same discount rate and you're just paying things a lot later than you would originally pay, you see a big NPV benefit, but there is also the impact from the discount rate.\n\nJosh Milberg -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nOkay, Alex. That's great, thanks for that. And then I also wanted to ask if you guys could comment a little further on your year-end capacity guidance and just talk about what you're assuming both as far as the evolution of yield over the remainder of the year and what you're assuming for a recovery of corporate demand. I ask that in part because we know that in the past, we had a bigger dependent in some of your local peers on business travelers I just wanted to get some color around what you're seeing and what you're anticipating there?\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nHey, Josh. Abhi here. Yeah. So I think first of all, we've been very pleased with the evolution so far, from what we've been able to do from April onwards to now and then on to September. We're well ahead of what we had thought on our first-quarter call, which was 40% by December. Now we think it's at least going to be 60% which is a huge improvement. There is no question that and this is probably global that leisure demand is so far ahead in the recovery, we can see that in our booking channels for example, the site and the app are much more ahead on a year-over-year basis than corporate is, but we are seeing nice improvements in corporate as well, July versus June and August versus July.\n\nSo I expect that this sequential improvement to continue and I think that right now leisure is -- it's safe-to-safe probably well over 50% of last year's levels. Corporate is behind, but catching up. And so I think being at 60% overall that's going to be more biased toward domestic less toward international. I think you're going to have leisure above that number may be a corporate little bit -- little bit below, but everything that we are seeing so far supports the sequential growth that we have been doing.\n\nMost importantly we've been very measured in how we're ramping up this capacity. So it's ramping up smoothly week-by-week, month-by-month. We're not having any big jumps in between, giving time for demand to catch up, giving us time to build the curves as well as we get bigger and bigger over the next couple of months. So I think that even by the end of the year, leisure is going to be ahead. Corporate will be behind leisure, but we are seeing both of them recover and so far demand has kept up to the capacity that we are doing, and I feel very, very good given the financial metrics that we were holding ourselves accountable for, as John said this flying has to cover the variable margin in a comfortable way, it has to help in generating cash for the airline.\n\nI expect that this sequential growth to continue and to the extent that we can do better than 60%, we're ready for that. I think there were sort of being flexible and taking advantage of the opportunities as they come.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd Josh, I think it's important to note the deal we cut with our lessors, and when we did that, we had a more conservative assumption in place that's to our benefit now, right. And so we obviously have less payments going forward, than we believe will see in terms of demand. So even if that the leisure business mix isn't where we expected to be -- or want it to be, let's say, we're still being to be much better off.\n\nJosh Milberg -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nNo, John, Abhi, that makes a lot of sense, what you said. And did you think that it does make sense or a reasonable assumption could be that yields stay at the same level over the remainder of the year, what are you thinking there?\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nI think there's going to be a steady improvement. We've already seen average fares come up very nicely over the last three to four weeks. And a very good news is that the volume of demand has held up as those average fares have come up. Average fares are still down as they are all over the world, but they are coming up. And so I expect those yields to continue improving as the corporate mix gets a little bit better, as the customer gets more confidence in the health and safety on board, in the traveling experience, as hotels open up, experience has opened up over the country, as cities open up.\n\nSo I think the yields are going to continue to improve together with the volumes. And I think that's going to drive the revenue improvement month-by-month and that we're going to try and keep pace with capacity. So I expect to yields to continue improving sequentially every single month.\n\nJosh Milberg -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nOkay, that's great. And if I could just squeeze in one more quick one, you guys mentioned that the E1s that Breeze is going to take. Are they going to take those on the sublease terms -- that were initially established or was it adjustment there?\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nYes.\n\nJosh Milberg -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\n\nOkay. That's great, thank you guys.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\n\nSavi Syth -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nGood morning, everyone. If I might just follow-up on the fleet question here. Could you provide what you expect in terms of delivery timings over the next 18 months, I think there were a few still that you're planning on taking delivery but I might be wrong there? And then also kind of tied to that, do you expect any more E-Jet removals in 2021?\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, Savi, so we have an agreement where we don't have any capex requirements over the next two years. And so obviously there were some aircraft that were built by Embraer but they were all lessor financed and so we will be taking a few Embraers and a few Airbus aircraft over the next, call it 12 to 18 months, already built aircraft. But the payment profile starts with what we did with the other lessors and so we have a significant runway of reduced rent in a few months with no rent at all, similar to what we did on our other deals. And so that was kind of part of the overall agreement to ensure that we have the appropriate run away going forward.\n\nThere are a lot of aircraft that are exiting the fleet, I mean, we still have a deal with LOT in Poland, but I think everything is kind of on pause, even Breeze delayed a little bit their entry into service, but you will still continue to see E1s exiting the fleet over the next couple of years and it's really important to highlight that we pushed off all other deliveries to 2024 and beyond. Right. And so, this is -- we have help from an aircraft standpoint in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and so that provides a significant amount of runway from a fleet perspective and we have no financing risk going forward because the deliveries are coming from the lessors.\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nYeah, and when we developed the management plan, we assumed the worse. Right. We assumed that no aircraft would leave the fleet and so everything that we are able to do now is generating upside. Right. So the two aircraft that are going to Breeze this year. There is a third one that leaves the fleet this year and kind of delivers early next year. Though, those were not sort of in our management plan, in our ASK to our stakeholders. Right. We didn't expect them to leave the fleet when we were building the management plan.\n\nThe sale of the two aircraft that we've done, we sold two aircraft in this environment, which was also a positive surprise, it was not something we were, when we built this in April, it wasn't something that was on the cards, but it's a few 10s of millions of reals of incremental cash that is going to come through the door in Q3, right. So a lot of positive news, but all consistent with the concept that we always talked about of hoping for the best and preparing for the worse. So all of these positive news from Breeze and from aircraft sales and early redeliveries are all positive based -- compared to our original forecast.\n\nSavi Syth -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nThat's super helpful. And Alex, maybe if I can ask just on that, there are a few moving parts on the kind of the cash side as we head into 2021, if you can assume things plateau at this 40% of demand by year-end level that you're expecting, what could cash burn look like in 2021? I know that's unrealistic. I'm just trying to get a sense of, once the relief on taxes and fees kind of get reversed and maybe you have a little bit more on rent to pay or may be less. So what does cash flow look like in 2021?\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nI think what we have now is a roadmap of -- we know that we can sustain the cash burn that we guided to of BRL3 million in the second half, there is some seasonality in that. Third quarter is a little bit higher, fourth quarter is going to be lower, but we kind of know the roadmap and we have an understanding with all of our stakeholders that this is the plan for now. Right. If things change, the plan may change and even our agreements with them may change. Right. I think we've gotten to a very constructive collaboration where everybody has signed up to helping Azul and everybody has the awareness that it's the best thing for everyone for them to support Azul and get us to the other side of this crisis.\n\nSo if the cash burn accelerates, right. I mean there are a lot of if's there. We may have to sit down and renegotiate it, it all will depend on what our cash position is, what potentially we may raise additional capital. We've gotten this again it's all -- the management plan is built under this very strong foundation of all stakeholders pitching in, and if we can raise additional capital under the right conditions, we will, right, and that may allow us to sustain a higher cash burn if that becomes a reality, right. So there are so many if's there that if our current cash position can sustain a higher cash burn that's great. But if it can't, we have a roadmap and we have an understanding that we will have to negotiate again and we're confident that we will have the support that we need to.\n\nThe uncertainty that we have maybe back in April, right, are we going to have enough cash? I'm very confident now that we're going to have enough cash right, and that may be under different scenarios for daily cash burn. But we are not worried about having enough cash.\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nBut Savi, I think it's really important that the deal we got with the lessors is through the end of 2021. We have significant rent reductions through 2021, OK. So I don't -- I don't know of another airline that's been able to negotiate a deal like that that you talk about if demand is at 60% next year, we are not paying full rents until 2022. And so we have a significant rent reduction for the first six months and the second six months of 2021. And that's the plan in place and so obviously things can change, there could be a second wave, but we prepared the airline for a worst-case scenario and we're already seeing things much better than that.\n\nAnd so you've seen that we've tried to guide to that to what you're seeing in the third and the fourth quarter, but that does not go away in 2021. And then even in addition to that what we pay in rent in 2022 is flat rents to what we were paying pre-COVID. So it's not like we snapped back in 2022 with higher rents. We negotiated with our lessors that only goes into effect in lease extensions and repayment starting in 2023 and many of those over the term of the lease. So that will be paid over a 10 year period in many instances, and so we've created a significant amount of runway through our stakeholders, because our stakeholders understand that this is a highly profitable business.\n\nWe have a sustainable network and we've got a great franchise here. And I think that that's the significant difference from what you're seeing from other airlines in the world.\n\nSavi Syth -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nDefinitely a lot more [indecipherable]. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Victor Mizusaki with Bradesco BBI.\n\nVictor Mizusaki -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you. I have two questions here. The first one is just a follow-up on Josh's question about leasing liability. So to double-check, here me, Alex, so there is no change in the discount rate to calculate in the NPV right?\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nCan you repeat the question, Vic?\n\nVictor Mizusaki -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst\n\nBecause -- you mentioned about the discount rate to calculate NPV of the leasing contracts. So just to double-check, I mean, so there is no change or no increase in the discount rate?\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nNo, there is, I mean the discount rate follows our cost of capital, right. And so our cost of capital, certainly was much lower pre-COVID than it is right now. Right. And IFRS essentially requires you to recognize the lease liability, when at the start of every lease or at the modification of any lease. And so that's what we're doing. Right. It's not the same rate across the board, but like I said, there is, when you look at the NPVs, there is a benefit from later payments, there is a benefit from the higher discount rate and there is a benefit from reductions in rent payments, in discounts and also in early redeliveries of aircraft. Right.\n\nEverything else, I think the smallest one -- the smallest effect of the three is the discount, but it's there and the rest is fairly even.\n\nVictor Mizusaki -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst\n\nAnd Alex when I take a look on the presentation, you also mentioned about the change of some contracts to power by the hour. So I don't know if you can comment if this is material to cover this entity as well?\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nVictor, we have no power-by-the-hour contract.\n\nVictor Mizusaki -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst\n\nOkay.\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nThis is -- no, let me just try to clarify to make sure. I think the majority of the airlines in the world are probably going to do a power-by-the-hour. Right. That's kind of fairly easy and fairly standard across the board. This is a much better deal than a power-by-the-hour like John mentioned. It's a set profile with a cushion to what the recovery is that we're seeing right and so we keep that upside.\n\nObviously, we are swimming in cash. Right. There are provisions. This is a partnership, we work under a win-win concept and so obviously we're not going to try to do grade while all of our suppliers and partners do badly. Right. But everybody's in this together and everybody has been very supportive, but unless we're swimming in cash, right, this is a set rent profile with the cushion to what we're seeing in terms of demand recovery and to what Abhi is able to utilize the aircraft. Right. But it's not a power-by-the-hour.\n\nVictor Mizusaki -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst\n\nOkay and just last one. Now that you basically sold your stake in TAP, is there any risk that may be TAP that you try to probably return some of their aircraft to Azul?\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nWe have a contract in place, right, and so, in fact, two of the aircraft that we just sold to a leasing company, we're unleased to TAP and so we have a contract in place and so there is no --\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nYeah. The markets saw value in the fact that these aircraft have a sublease to happen. So they were willing to pay for it. So I don't think there's any expectation on any kind of disruption there and I think if this crisis has taught us anything, is that if you want a early redelivery on aircraft or reject aircraft outright, there is one way to do it. It's under Chapter 11. If you're not under Chapter 11 you can make marginal changes right, but nobody is going to be able to deliver an aircraft years and years in advance to a lessor unless they go through a very dramatic and disruptive approach because like we said in the previous call, right.\n\nThe asset is no longer the aircraft, right. The aircraft used to be seen as an asset, but who -- who wants an aircraft today, no airline in the world wants additional aircraft. The asset is a sustainable business model, it's a constructive long-term partnership that can generate cash and that's what we have.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd Victor, TAP just received an injection of capital of EUR1.2 billion. Right. And the state took over the ownership from David in Azul and so it's a sovereign deal. Right. And so I think that that's something that's very encouraging going forward for our leases, for our debt, and certainly for our partnership for the joint venture.\n\nVictor Mizusaki -- Bradesco BBI -- Analyst\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Citibank [Phonetic].\n\nMike Linenberg -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nYeah, hey, actually, Deutsche Bank. But -- Germany versus New York, right, anyway. Couple of questions here. I guess to Abhi, just looking at your progression and how your capacity recovers through the year and you have it getting to 60% of 2019 by the month of -- by December. I think you've also indicated that demand by December will also be at 60%. So presumably, we're looking at flat load factors, year-over-year by the month of December. This quarter we were down, I don't know, close to 10 points. When we look at July, August and September, where the capacity goes from about 23% to 43%, are you seeing meaningful convergence on the load side such that you feel comfortable that supply and demand will be back in equilibrium by year-end?\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nHey, Mike. Yes. So I mean, if you look at our July traffic, we flew at 78%, 79% load factor, right. So, I think that you kind of had the initial shock of the crisis, you also had very high no-show rates initially. And now you had very high change\/cancel rates in the month of April, for example. Those things have stabilized. And so you also now have time with higher booking volumes to build a booking curve that we didn't really have for the month of April. So yeah, I think for us, load factor is more of an output. I'm not really targeting a load factor, but yes, I think load factors are going to be in the high 70s for the foreseeable future, if not a little bit higher than that. And so I think we've already reached that position, we were at 76% in June, 78%, 79% in July; and I think that's where we'll be going forward.\n\nWhat has improved quite significantly in the last three weeks is average fares. And that's been a very positive sign for the market overall, especially for us because the fact that we're alone in 80%, 85% of our routes, we're always pushing the envelope on that, we always have been, historically, and we continue to do so. And it works for us, it works especially with close in demand and close in revenue. And so to the extent that we feel like the revenue maximizing solution is a load factor of 76% versus 78%, I'll certainly take that just to avoid dilution in our routes, which obviously we're alone. So yes, I think it's going to be in the range of 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%. And again, the fact that we're ramping up capacity very steady week-by-week, month-by-month; also gives time for demand to catch up, gives us time to build the booking curve, and gives us time to make adjustments as needed.\n\nSo far, we've been rewarded in the increases that we've taken. Initially, I would say it was more on the volume side. And now lately, it's come on the average fare side and volumes have held up with those higher average fares. So, certainly looking positive for this continued sequential increase. And I think we have all of the toolkits, given our network, given our connectivity and all the different fleet options that we have to take full advantage of the recovery that continues over the next couple of months.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nHey Mike, I just want to highlight that Brazil has been shut down for the last three or four months and it just started opening up in the month of July. If you think about the state of Sao Paulo which is the big economic center, it's just started easing restriction, they just lowered kind of the rating over the last two weeks, kind of allowing for more and more people to go out and about, go to restaurants, schools still have not opened here yet. That's now projected to open in October. And so the fact that we're seeing this demand now as the economy slowly reopens, that's what gives us kind of hope that you're going to see a sequential improvement as we move forward.\n\nMike Linenberg -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nYeah. I'm just -- here in the US, we're not even getting the volumes. And the fact is you're getting the volumes and then to Abhi's point, both just recently and even earlier on the call, that you're seeing the sequential improvement in yield. So if you can get volumes and that type of improvement on the yield side, you could have one of the better fourth quarters or at least one of the better months of December than any airline when you look around the world. So, that's why -- that's kind of what drove my question there.\n\nJust maybe a second question on LATAM, Brazil and yourselves. I know that that turned on in August, and I think, John, you did make that point that there is no sort of local JV or codeshare arrangement like that, really, I think anywhere in the world when you think about depth and breadth. And from a domestic market perspective on the fact that you were able to do that, I think it's going to be -- it's going to have -- it's going to show up in your numbers. And I'm just curious, as you look out over the next, say, quarter or two, as you think about possible contribution; is it a couple of load factor points on Azul, whether it's through connections or people who sort of cross utilize the carriers? Is it a few points there of load factor? Is it a few points of margin; sort of how do you think about it? Because what you have is very unique and powerful.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah, Mike. I think one thing is, the market has not understood this partnership. This would never have been possible six months ago, we never even thought of it. And so this is just a way that we've taken advantage of the market opportunity. And so we probably wouldn't have gotten antitrust approval to do it six months ago. And so it's a way for us to increase demand and that's a great thing. And when you think about the power of our network, and the cities served, and the size of their network, the size of their loyalty business, right it brings a tremendous amount of value to customers and to both networks. And it's a way to get both of us flying a lot faster.\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nYeah, Mike, the answer to your question is yes. It's going to be some form of incremental revenue. Probably more on the load factor side. That's probably fair. But it's going to bring connecting traffic. Of course, we combine the power of our distribution channels as well. We're both obviously very significant here in terms of distribution. And of course, accrual possibilities for our loyalty members. And so, my hope is that, yes, we absolutely utilize each other's connecting networks to deliver the best possible options for the customers, and they don't have to go anywhere else. And I think if we can do that, both of us will be able to recover better with this partnership than without.\n\nMike Linenberg -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\nGreat. And then just one quick last one to Alex. Just the TAP bond, when does that mature?\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\n2026.\n\nMike Linenberg -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\n\n2026. Okay, very good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steve Trent with Citibank.\n\nSteve Trent -- Citibank -- Analyst\n\nThank you, everybody, and good morning. And glad that Mike Linenberg hasn't taken over for me at Citi. But just a few quick ones for you. First, when we think about government policy, I don't mean the funding, but the other things that the government has done, some breaks on landing fees. I guess there's been some adjustments on cash refunds to people that canceled trips. Do you see any longer-term changes that the government is looking to make that could facilitate competition, this business about airlines having to pay customers' lodging, if there's a thunderstorm and flights are canceled, stuff like that?\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nHey, Steve. I think one thing that hasn't been highlighted enough in the new Law 925 that was just recently approved is moral damages can no longer be claimed for lawsuits. And so, that was a big problem. You saw that Brazilian Airlines paid 20 times, 30 times what a US carrier would pay. And so, that was embedded in our cost structure. And so, that law changed that. And so, that's a great so long-term benefit for the aviation industry overall.\n\nYou highlighted the reimbursement. There's other smaller things like the deferral of the landing fees during the pandemic. But I think the biggest one that I'm probably most proud of is the consumer protection has changed because of the moral damages no longer exist. And that's a big long-term benefit. And I think this government is very sensitive to aviation. They understand the importance of it.\n\nI've talked several times to senior people inside the government. If you think about the tax revenue that aviation brings or the tax revenue that just Azul brings, Azul brought BRL2 billion in tax revenue to the government last year. And so, that's important. To help protect this franchise and to protect this industry overall is very important. So I think you'll see more movement from the government on additional provisional measures, kind of a restart plan to kind of help this industry overall because this industry helps the taxi drivers, the hotels. It helps business in so many cities in Brazil. And so, I think that you'll consider the government make moves to kind of help this industry going forward.\n\nObviously, Brazil does not have the resources that the US has, right? And it doesn't have the resources that Europe has, but they do have the ability and the willingness to change the laws to kind of help make Brazil a much more competitive place.\n\nSteve Trent -- Citibank -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Very helpful, John. I appreciate that. And just one quick follow-up. Could you remind me sort of on a normal cycle basis, approximately what percentage of Azul's ticket sales are refundable tickets?\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nFor refundable -- hey, Steve. It's Abhi here. It's actually pretty small, fully refundable. We have different fare products, and most of them have change and cancel fees associated with. Fully, fully refundable, we only sell actually through our call center. So it's a very small percentage. If you're asking about what's sort of outstanding in terms of refunds, in terms of all the changes to the network, it's been very positive that over 80% of the outstanding tickets out there that we've changed are actually in the forms of credit shells, not refund.\n\nSo the future refund liability is actually pretty low, not something that should change our cash or anything like that going forward in a meaningful way. And we're actively trying to get those customers to change over to credit shells. But the good news is that the vast majority, over 80% of the customers that have been affected by the changes in the network over the last three, four months, have opted to leave their money with Azul, and we'll potentially use that in the future. Much of that would break, to be honest with you. But the actual refund component is very small.\n\nSteve Trent -- Citibank -- Analyst\n\nOkay, that's perfect. Thanks, Abhi. And thanks, everybody, and stay healthy.\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Pablo Monsivais with Barclays.\n\nPablo Monsivais -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. The first one is, why is demand picking up so fast while the COVID cases in Brazil keep rising? Are you seeing that the population is less fearful of getting infected, or what's going on? Why we're not seeing this in other regions in Latin America? And the second question is on the cash burn guidance. Are you incorporating already the buildup of deferred revenues for the summer season? Thanks.\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nI can start with the demand question. So I think that -- at least I can speak only about Azul and what we are doing to capture this demand. One of the things that's unique to us is the connectivity in our network and how we utilize different aircraft in our fleet to maximize the capture of this demand. So I'll give you an example. We used we used to fly from Campinas to Santos Dumont in Rio 14 times a day on Embraers. Now we don't have the corporate demand for 14 flights a day, but we have leisure demand that wants to connect. So we fly five times a day on A320s. Each one of them comes to our bank in Campinas and then distributes to over 50 cities.\n\nSo I think with our network, with our fleet flexibility, we're able to provide really convenient options to customers that want to go for leisure, they want to go visit friends and family or take care of a loved one, or small and medium businesses that need to go visit a customer, restart their shop, restart their business in different locations. So I think there is an aspect of Brazil opening up in general that's helping overall. But I think there is a very unique aspect to how we build our network.\n\nOur hub in Campinas, for example, is very close already to being at what it was pre-crisis. And that's because of the connectivity that we're delivering with the different fleet options that we have and through all the different destinations that we have. So I think that it's -- Brazil opening up is one aspect, but I think that we're disproportionately able to capture a lot of that demand through the breadth and the unique connections that we offer in our network.\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nYeah. And on the cash burn, so we gave you guidance for second half, right? Obviously, there is seasonality in Brazil. Q4 should have better cash burn than what we guided to. Q3 should have worse cash burn that we guided to. But that's all embedded in the projections that we gave. So our expectations of how the booking curve will behave and the way we're seeing the advanced purchase timeline and the natural seasonality that we see in Brazil, with some quarters being great in terms of generating cash and maybe not so good revenue, some quarters, you have great revenue, but then you don't generate cash as much, right? That's all embedded in our projections.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nAnd just on -- in the third quarter that Alex highlighted, we made some moves that were difficult to do, but will pay back over the next three to four months. And so obviously, letting crew members go. And we said we're going to hire everybody back when we get back to full speed. But some of that cost will be embedded in the third quarter. But you'll see the savings by the time you get into the fourth quarter, right? And so, I think that those are some things. But when you think about the ATL balance and the forward booking of sales, if Abhi continues to add to the network and continues to forward sell much more, there's the ability to kind of generate cash through that channel as well. And so, that's something that -- you're literally adding 50% more flights month-over-month, and that could be very positive from a cash flow perspective.\n\nPablo Monsivais -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Maybe if I can squeeze one follow-up question to your comment, is what are you seeing, guys, in terms of cost and the reduction on labor from temporary initiatives? And how are we seeing costs from permanent initiatives? Headcount was significantly reduced. When your construction capacity is back, how will costs move? And what maybe is the headcount number, I don't know, in 2021, 2022?\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nYes. I think the important accomplishment here was to make our salary expense variable, right? Normally, the majority of salary is fixed. It's mainly pilots and flight attendants that have variable pay that go up and down, according to capacity, according to how much they fly. But through our negotiations with our unions and through the headcount reductions that we've made, many of the volunteer programs that we offered, and we saw a big number of crew members signing up.\n\nWe were essentially able to make that salary expense variable. So if we -- we're seeing that the recovery is happening faster than what we originally projected. So obviously, there will be more labor expense than originally projected, but that's more than compensated by the revenue that we're getting, right? We continue to only fly what covers variable cost with a healthy margin, right. And if, for example, on the other hand, if the recovery maybe slows down a bit, then the salary expense will go down as well, right. So that was, I think, a very positive aspect of the negotiation and the development of the management plan that we were able to make this variable.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nBut it's important to note, we will be a much more efficient airline in 2021 and 2022. There is no doubt about it. Our headquarters is leaner. Our airports are leaner. We will be a much more efficient airline going forward. And so, once again, crisis brings opportunity, and we need to make sure that on the backside of this crisis, we're a better airline. And so, you've seen the technology that we've employed at the airports and everything that we're doing to become a much better airline. I do believe, over time, we will hire people back, but we're going to grow again. And we'll have the opportunity to make room, but we will be much more efficient from an FTEs per aircraft on a going forward basis.\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nYes. We're looking at this as a reset and as an opportunity for us to start up again. We're still a young company, a young airline. We started up less than 12 years ago. But especially on the overhead side, right as John is mentioning, we're seeing new ways to work, right. We're seeing that maybe there are some structures that we had in the past that we don't need to rebuild that we've learned and adjusted to.\n\nOn the operational side, the physical distancing is leading to a lot more utilization of technology to check-in. So yeah, I don't think you're going to ever get back to the same level that you had before. We'll be able to get to a post-crisis efficiency level that's a lot higher than what we started with. And that's certainly a goal that we have here and that we're already managing too.\n\nPablo Monsivais -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nGreat. So reading between the lines, the percentage of temporary initiatives on your labor costs might be not as big? And then because we are seeing a permanent change in the more efficient turning, I guess, for the future?\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. We talked a lot about the BRL7 billion of working capital that we created through the management plan. But some of that-that's just through the end of 2021. We will be a more efficient in 2020 as well, right? And so, some of that savings is going to be permanent. And so, we just sized for you what we've created over the next 18 months because that's what we're projecting when we will be at almost pre-COVID levels in terms of flying.\n\nPablo Monsivais -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Loren [indecipherable] with MetLife.\n\nLoren -- MetLife -- Analyst\n\nHi, Alex, David, Andrea. Thanks for the call. Congratulations for the good news in this challenging environment. And I have a couple of questions. The first [Technical Issues] of that. And the other one is regarding capital structure, just thinking in 2021, what's the expectation regarding leverage for this year is expecting to increase? And it's not a surprise, but if we trying to think in 2021, what's your expectations? Thank you.\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nSo I'm going to answer the capital structure question first. We couldn't hear your first question. So if you could later -- after I answer, maybe you could follow-up and repeat it. So the way we're managing through this crisis, obviously, with the huge drop in revenue, right we are adjusting capacity and reducing expenses, but no airline in the world is able to reduce expenses as much as revenues have fallen. So that is going to affect your net debt one way or another, right either by burning cash or by taking additional debt. And that will increase our leverage.\n\nBut when we forecast, when we look at the next five years, we believe we're going to converge to an acceptable leverage, probably in 2022. So we're not -- and everybody, I think, understands that 2020 and 2021 are extraordinary years that don't reflect sort of the true performance of the airline or the true capital structure of the airline. So 2020 and 2021 will probably be still years when you're attributing a lot of emphasis to cash, right and making sure that the airlines that you're looking at have enough cash to get to the other side. And then 2022 will probably be the year where we're under sub four in terms of leverage. And that's, I think, a better reflection of what our capital structure will be.\n\nNow in terms -- you saw our release on cash. We were very happy with the performance that we had in cash in the second quarter because it's all about making sure you have the runway to get to the other side, right? Not all airlines in the world will have the runway to get to the other side, and they may have to resort to more radical approaches, like some airlines have already done in the region. But we're happy with the cash position. And when we look at what -- like we said, the end of the crisis is expected to be kind of end of '21, beginning of '22.\n\nWhen we look at the expected cash position that we will have, it's comfortably above our minimum cash position. But I think it is prudent of us to consider increasing that cash liquidity, right? Because the trends are positive. We are feeling encouraged. But I don't think anybody has full visibility as to when this crisis is going to end, right? We have an expectation, but we have no assurances that we're going to get there. So we will be monitoring the capital markets. We're still monitoring the talking to BNDES. We believe BNDES is still an option. And when we see an opportunity to access the capital markets, we will do so. Maybe that will be equity. Maybe that will be debt. But we'll take that decision if and when it comes up.\n\nLoren -- MetLife -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you. Very clear. And then the first question was regarding the headlines regarding the coupon payment of October, that if you can provide any update or thoughts regarding potential postponement? Or I know that you already made a very good shop in conversations with lessors, with the others, with banks or other financial institutions, but what's the guidance regarding coupon payment or relationship with bondholders?\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nYes, the coupon will be paid. The article, I think, is well written. The headline, not so much. I think there's a little bit of -- I think the whole --\n\nLoren -- MetLife -- Analyst\n\nI know.\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nThe whole industry is kind of chasing clicks, unfortunately. But the article is accurate, right? Our bondholders are reaching out, and we obviously want to have a channel and a communication with our bondholders. And if there is a chance for us to raise additional capital through terms that are acceptable to us, that's all positive. But there is -- there are no negotiations, and the coupon will be paid in October.\n\nLoren -- MetLife -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stefan Styk with Bank of America.\n\nStefan Styk -- Bank of America -- Analyst\n\nHi, thank you for taking my question. So, it looks like in the second half of the year, you have lease payments of around BRL235 million per quarter, which looks much higher than the second quarter payments. So I'm just wondering what -- how steep the ramp-up is at the turn of the year into 2021?\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nJust to be clear, I mean, we had 70 flights a day in the second quarter, and we're going to be at 400 in September. And so obviously, lease payments will go up as we ramp up but it's a significant difference in terms of capacity.\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nYes. I think what's important here is that our expected ramp-up in capacity and revenue generation is going to be well ahead of the ramp-up in lease payments, and that is the bonus -- that is the difference that we keep in terms of cash generation, in terms of helping our cash burn as well. So, I expect the ramp up to continue December, January and onwards; and we'll go as much as demand takes us, and it's going to be -- there are no artificial limits in kind of that we have to stop at a certain point.\n\nBut we are very, very confident that even with the discounts that John talked about for the first six months of next year, we will be already at those levels of capacity this year. And so, for the foreseeable -- for the life for the next 18 months of these lease agreements, we expect to be comfortably well ahead in terms of capacity, in terms of revenue generation; and that is the buffer, that is the upside that we get to keep.\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nYeah. And one thing that I just want to comment on the comparison of Q2 to Q3. Our expectation -- our original expectation was that the cash burn in Q2 was going to be of upto BRL4 million per day, and we expect it to end Q2 with BRL300 million fewer reals than we actually ended up, right. The fact that we over-delivered in Q2 should not be read as Q3 getting worse, right. Q3 is going to be better than what we expected Q2, it's just that we did -- if I say so myself, a great job in Q2, but that shouldn't be seen as a negative, it's certainly a positive.\n\nStefan Styk -- Bank of America -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe company will now answer questions placed on the webcast platform.\n\nAndrea Bottcher -- Manager of Investor Relations\n\nWe have one question from Bruno Amorim from Goldman Sachs. Can you please provide the percentage of passengers and revenues that come from business versus leisure in '19? Besides being a headwind on passenger volumes could eventually structurally lower business-related demand, also weight on margin in the future?\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nHey, Bruno. So I mean, we always said pre-crisis, we were around 60%, 65% corporate, and that was the nature of our network, we flew to many small cities alone. I think that right now, obviously, leisure is much ahead and corporate is coming up behind. But I think that we have all of the tools to adapt to whatever the new demand environment is. The example that I gave of Campinas to Santos Domo is perfect, we used to fly 14 times a day with an Embraer, and now for the next three months, maybe we don't have that demand, but we definitely have demand to fly four or five times a day with A320s, which deliver 174 passengers each time to our banks in DCP in terms of connecting traffic.\n\nAnd so I think we have the flexibility in our fleet, we have the breadth in our network already at 88 destinations by September. So to the extent that we don't have the high frequency in markets for the next three or six months, maybe the demand is going to require you to have more breadth, more destinations, more connectivity. We are easily able to accommodate that uniquely, much better than anybody else in the region. And in addition, we have other tools in our toolkit.\n\nWe've just adapted the world's first Embraer airplane into a cargo airplane. It's a two-day conversion; all you do is remove some seats. And so if we don't need some Embraers over the next three to six months, I know that there is e-commerce demand to medium-sized cities that can deliver next day and two-day products at below trip cost of an Embraer, significantly better than a 737 freighter that somebody else could offer.\n\nSo we have all those tools in our toolkit to adapt to whatever the demand environment is going to be. I do expect corporate to come back, and -- but maybe in the transition period, we'll have to structure our network accordingly and use other things in our toolkit.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. And one other thing, too, Bruno, is Brazilians don't travel enough, right. And so maybe the US has a fall in travel demand going forward, maybe other parts of the world do. And so maybe our growth curve is not as steep as we had thought, but Brazilians are traveling almost one-third of what Chileans are traveling, absolutely no reason for that. Brazilians are traveling less than what Colombians are traveling; obviously, no reason for that.\n\nWith the size of Brazil, the opportunity is huge, and we will continue to find pockets of demand throughout the entire country. When you think about everybody doing these Zoom conferences, that's not happening in the agro business, that's not happening all throughout Brazil and the small cities that we serve. And so I think that's a strength of our network that nobody can really replicate.\n\nAndrea Bottcher -- Manager of Investor Relations\n\nOkay. We have another question from an investor. So what happens to the BNDES funding now? You have generated such good liquidity.\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nYes, I think it's a good liquidity on a relative basis, right. But I don't think we need to be prudent. Like we said, we need to hope for the best but prepare for the worst. And I think preparing for the worst is increasing our cash cushion. I think that's still recommended, that's still probably the right thing to do because we don't know what could happen, right. We're still waiting for corporate to come back, there are some green shoots from corporate, but we can't guarantee.\n\nI think if somebody could guarantee to us that the trends are going to continue, then I think you're right, maybe we don't need it but we don't know that. And we could be quickly if there is a second wave, if this pandemic takes longer to end, right, we -- we still remember how quickly things evolved in March and April, right. This could get ugly very quickly. So, I don't think we can discard the opportunity to take additional cash.\n\nAnd I think the BNDES is an option that is out there but I think even the BNDES would like us to see if we have other options out there. And we will be monitoring the capital markets to see under which conditions capital could be available to us if and when we see the opportunity. But the BNDES is still an option, it's still out there, and we continue to have regular discussions with them because it may be still -- BNDES is a lender of less resort, and I don't think anybody can guarantee that they wouldn't be needed.\n\nAndrea Bottcher -- Manager of Investor Relations\n\nOkay. One more question. How much liquid cash do you have?\n\nAlexandre Wagner Malfitani -- Chief Financial Officer and Investor Relations Officer\n\nSo, we -- we have no restricted cash, which is an important concept here, right. I see some analysts and some airlines kind of including cash -- restricted cash in their cash position. So I think it depends on what your definition of liquid cash is. I don't think restricted cash is liquid cash, but I see some people calling it that, right. If you just call it pure cash at hand, we have BRL1.6 billion. In Brazil, receivables are cash, right, and including receivables, we have BRL2.3 billion. And we have our TAP bond, which I normally wouldn't call it cash, but it's certainly a heck of a lot more liquid than restricted cash, right. So if you include restricted cash in your cash position, you certainly should include the TAP bond in our cash position.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nEspecially now that there is basically a sovereign guarantee on it.\n\nAndrea Bottcher -- Manager of Investor Relations\n\nAnd one more question. Could you talk about what makes your LATAM codeshare different; is it size, nature, revenue split?\n\nAbhi Manoj Shah -- Chief Revenue Officer\n\nYes. LATAM codeshare is definitely the largest in terms of breadth that I know of. Most codeshares tend to be international partners connecting with domestic partners. You do have two examples of domestic codeshares in the US at least, but they are geographically focused on each coast. This one is the entire domestic market in Brazil, and so combined pre-crisis that's 50 million passengers, 60 million passengers, which falls within the scope.\n\nSo it's certainly unique in the scale, it's certainly unique in the breadth, and they're certainly unique in the opportunities and the benefits that we can provide in terms of connecting our customers in terms of the portfolio of destinations and the loyalty program benefits that we will provide and want to keep adding to overtime. So it certainly encompasses a lot more and provides a great platform for us to recover each of our networks going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to invite John to proceed with his closing statements. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn Peter Rodgerson -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nI'd like to thank everybody. And feel free to reach out to any of us after the call if you have any questions. I just want to remind everybody, we have a great business, we have a great team, and we're taking advantage of this crisis to look for opportunities that will make this airline a lot stronger in the long run.

Under no circumstances should contact details contained in the email or attachments be relied upon to verify the request whether these consist of a physical address, an email address or a phone number.\n\nBusinesses must ensure that they have robust policies and procedures in place to deal with requests of this nature including escalating the decision making function to supervisory positions and making direct contact with a trusted known person in the suppliers organisation.\n\nAll existing business relationships should be reviewed without delay and defensive policies and procedures put in place.\n\nWhen working from home be mindful when carrying out roles you would not usually do.

Photo: Supplied\n\nHotels throughout New Zealand are fielding thousands of domestic cancellations as a result of new Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nWith Auckland placed in alert level 3 lockdown and the rest of New Zealand on alert level 2, hoteliers up and down the country are inundated by leisure and corporate travellers cancelling their accommodation.\n\nNew Zealand Hotel Owners Association executive director Amy Robens says the latest impact on the struggling sector is \"beyond grim\" and the ongoing repercussions are seemingly endless.\n\n\"Auckland is a big market for hoteliers throughout New Zealand when there is no international visitation and booking cancellations for domestic leisure and conferences, even just through to the end of August, is costing the struggling hotel sector many millions of dollars,\" she said.\n\nThe association supported the Government's decisive action to tackle Covid-19 community transmission, but said urgent financial relief including a targeted extension to the wage subsidy must go beyond Auckland.\n\n\"Hotels are particularly hard hit by enforced lockdowns given they can't reopen quickly and profitably in the same way as many other businesses. Hotels need to generate enough forward bookings to make their business viable, and given we are losing bookings many will return to single-digit occupancy,\" Robens said.\n\nHotels typically lose money unless they have 70 percent occupancy.\n\n\"Accommodation providers feel we have been side-stepped in the Government's $400 Tourism Recovery Package.

A new world awaits: a world without asphalt, road rage, roadside rubbish, middle-lane hogs or tailgaters. Or public toilets or recovery services, but let\u2019s not dwell.\n\nUsing a 4x4 as it was intended for the first time can be somewhat daunting, though. This, then, is a rough, step-by-step guide to off-roading. It\u2019s by no means a comprehensive instruction for every situation you could possibly find yourself in, but it contains lots of good advice \u2013 and, crucially, we hope, no bad advice.\n\nStep 1: Know your vehicle\n\nYou might be using a full-on 4x4, but even many modest crossovers have a surprising degree of ability. Four-wheel drive is crucial in poor conditions, but all-terrain tyres are even more essential. Tyre quality is typically what stands between a vehicle making it somewhere and back and not doing so.\n\nThe handbook will list off-roading angles: approach, breakover (ramp), departure and perhaps the angle at which it will tip over sideways. But unless you carry a protractor, these aren\u2019t essential to memorise.\n\nBetter to know what\u2019s vulnerable on the underside of the vehicle: if there are skidplates or if the sump, exhaust and more are exposed. Also from where, if you\u2019re among company (we\u2019d recommend you are), the vehicle can tow. 4x4s have hooks designed for this. Know how to get to the spare wheel, too. It\u2019s worth noting the wet wade depth and where the engine air intake is \u2013 although if you\u2019re challenging these on your first time out, you\u2019ve been quite ambitious.\n\nFinally, get to know what, if any, off-road-specific technology the car comes with; most modern 4x4s have hill descent control and perhaps stability control that can be tuned for different underwheel terrains.\n\nStep 2: Know where you're going\n\nIn short, you only want to drive where it\u2019s legal to do so. If you\u2019ve heard of people talking about green lanes, they mean byways that are open to all traffic, or unclassified roads. Both appear on Ordnance Survey (OS) maps, but that doesn\u2019t always mean you can drive on them. Access is restricted in winter on some and some are width-restricted or subject to other local by-laws."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/inews.co.uk\/news\/consumer\/eat-out-to-help-out-hmrc-exclusive-mcdonalds-burger-king-572360","domain":"inews.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-05 19:48:00","title":"McDonald's and Burger King claim half the cost of meals customers may not be entitled to","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/wp.inews.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/PRI_160331569.jpg?resize=640,360&strip=all&quality=90","content":"Exclusive\n\nTwo of the UK\u2019s largest fast food chains are claiming half the cost of meals despite many customers not qualifying for the Government\u2019s Eat Out to Help Out scheme, i can reveal.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s and Burger King are receiving taxpayer cash for meals even though customers are not eating their meals in the restaurants, which is a condition of the half price giveaway that has been rushed in by the Government to help the struggling hospitality trade.\n\nInsiders at both fast food companies confirmed there were loopholes that allowed customers to claim the 50 per cent of their meal even though they have no intention of eating it at a table at one of its outlets.\n\nThe i has also spoken to managers at McDonald\u2019s and Burger King restaurants who claimed they did not have the resources to prevent customers taking advantage of the scheme, which allows diners to have up to \u00a310 of their bill paid by the taxpayer for food and soft drink orders eaten in but not for takeaways.\n\nBurger sting\n\nSuraj Maharjan, the manager at the McDonald\u2019s at Holmers Farm Way in Wycombe, said it was \u201cimpossible to police\u201d who was actually ordering their meals to eat in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working under tough health restrictions,\u201d said Mr Maharjan. \u201cWe can\u2019t check every customer is eating in when they order even if they say they are.

That\u2019s the choice some believe UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will face when English students return to their classrooms next month. The country has only recently been able to open establishments like pubs and restaurants, which suffered badly during lockdown.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, said that England has \u201cprobably reached the limits\u201d of how open it can be, given the number of coronavirus cases in the country.\n\nOn the surface, it might seem a straightforward case of weighing up which is more important: a quick recovery from the economic downturn caused by lockdown, or students avoiding the \u201cgenerational catastrophe\u201d that the UN Secretary-General predicted if schools are not reopened.\n\nHowever, this is not how the government sees it. According to numerous UK government sources who were not permitted to speak about policy yet to be announced, here\u2019s where Downing Street is currently:\n\nFirst, the calculation has changed now that we have seen exactly how damaging the lockdown has been to the UK\u2019s economy. On Wednesday, it was revealed that the UK\u2019s GDP had fallen a record 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020.\n\nOne government minister told CNN: \u201cThere is huge harm caused by lockdown itself and that needs to be set against the obvious huge harm caused by the virus. When you set one against the other and realize how low transmissions are among schoolchildren \u2013 how do you justifiably come down on the side of economic catastrophe over schools?\u201d Public health experts have urged governments to treat claims that transmission is low in schools with caution, as it varies between age groups.\n\nSecond, contrary to the idea that there is a straight choice to be made, it\u2019s not a \u201czero-sum game,\u201d one government adviser told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case of if pubs and bars are open X will happen and if you open schools Y will happen. If everyone is compliant with the rules of social distancing, cleaning their hands, you can basically have both at once.\u201d\n\nThird, the two things are not unrelated. \u201cSchools are going back regardless, mostly because parents need to get back to work. Everything has a knock-on effect,\u201d said a senior civil servant.\n\nFourth, this disease is here and, despite optimistic signs, there is still no clear idea of when a vaccine will arrive. Government sources say that despite the scale of the tragedy, it is still most dangerous for the elderly and vulnerable. So, if most people can go back to some type of normality, the focus can be on local lockdowns and protecting the vulnerable.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Confusion and frustration hamper push to reopen schools 02:14 - Source: CNN\n\nIn short, the government might try to do everything at once. There will likely be a publicity drive placing \u201cmore emphasis on public responsibility both in messaging and enforceability,\u201d in order to have a \u201cthird way\u201d in which \u201chuman behavior is the first line of defense,\u201d according to the government adviser.\n\nPublic health experts fear the country is still not in a position to guarantee doing any of this safely and that come the grand reopening, Johnson could still find himself having to make a choice.\n\nThere is a widespread belief that the UK\u2019s test and trace program is still not up to scratch. Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College London, says \u201ca strong contact tracing system that can break chains of transmission and drive infections down\u201d is essential if schools are to be safe.\n\n\u201cContact tracing should reach 80% of new symptomatic cases and 80% of their contacts,\u201d she told CNN, adding, \u201cwe\u2019re probably reaching about 50-70% of symptomatic cases\u201d currently. Government sources claim that testing is higher than this, however it is very hard to get complete numbers since testing is now being carried out at a local level as well as by central government.\n\nIf testing is not where it needs to be, things could get out of hand quickly. \u201cIf we go back to the same level of contact that we had in March then we will go back to the same level of epidemic growth,\u201d says Graham Medley, professor of infectious disease modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nHe explains that reopening schools is dangerous not just because of transmissions, but because of the size of networks they create. \u201cA school of 500 children could connect 300-400 homes. And homes with more than one child who go to different schools, connecting all the households in both schools. So, you can see how, when all schools are open, the network can get enormous very quickly.\u201d\n\nBut opening them is a priority. Johnson himself said that there is a \u201cmoral duty\u201d to reopen schools this autumn. Natalie Perera, executive director of the Education Policy Institute, says \u201cthe most disadvantaged pupils (are) likely to have been hit the hardest by prolonged school closures,\u201d creating an \u201cattainment gap between the poorest pupils and the rest.\u201d The dilemma comes days after the government faced criticism from students, parents and teachers about the downgrading of estimated exam grades.\n\nOf course, it is impossible to ignore the fact that schools and economics have a significant impact on one another. Obviously, parents cannot go back to work if they have to stay home to look after children. But there\u2019s also the matter of Brits\u2019 confidence in their government.\n\n\u201cIf people see that it\u2019s possible to go to work, have schools open and go out to dinner while targeted measures quickly suppress local spikes, their economic behavior will be more normal,\u201d says Jonathan Portes, professor of economics at King\u2019s College London. \u201cIf restaurants and pubs are suddenly forced to close and teachers say they don\u2019t feel safe, this obviously undermines the government\u2019s strategy which ultimately affects confidence that life will return to normal.\u201d\n\nWhatever happens, it\u2019s going to be tricky. Either all things remain open with the government crossing its fingers that people obey the rules, or Johnson has to choose between children\u2019s education or reviving economic activity.\n\nGovernment critics say that the Prime Minister is himself partly responsible for his predicament, pointing to errors made in the early days of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe most obvious error was the abandonment of community testing in March, which meant we missed months of being able to effectively identify cases and trace the contacts,\u201d says Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology at the Royal Society of Medicine, adding that this means months later the country\u2019s test and trace system is inadequate.\n\nHe points to the delays in lockdown and stopping people entering the country, leading to the impression that the government was \u201cunderplaying the seriousness of the virus.\u201d He says the government\u2019s centralized control \u201cmade curbing outbreaks very difficult. A pandemic is essentially lots of local epidemics and it\u2019s easier to suppress these at a local level.\u201d\n\nAll of these criticisms are well known. Members of Johnson\u2019s own party privately bemoan the government\u2019s early response. Even Johnson\u2019s own education secretary said that there were \u201cthings we would take a different approach on.\u201d\n\nHowever, several months on, critics on both sides of his party now acknowledge that the country needs to start getting on with life as close to normal as possible. And that includes sending children back to school and keeping the pubs open \u2013 even as the country moves towards a winter that could see a second spike in infections."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/edmonton.ctvnews.ca\/alberta-adds-84-new-covid-19-cases-1-more-death-on-friday-1.5065013","domain":"edmonton.ctvnews.ca","published_date":"2020-08-14 21:42:00","title":"Alberta adds 84 new COVID-19 cases, 1 more death on Friday","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/polopoly_fs\/1.4948441.1590075944!\/httpImage\/image.png_gen\/derivatives\/landscape_960\/image.png","content":"EDMONTON -- Alberta recorded 84 new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, bringing the province's total to 12,053.\n\nAnother Albertan has also died due to the coronavirus, a woman in her 60s in the south zone.

They epitomised the kind of cheap, highly-processed food offerings that \u2013 deep-fried and served up with chips \u2013 were staple fare on school menus.\n\nThe new version of the Twizzler, available in two flavours, is made to \u201chealthier\u201d recipes with lower fat, salt and sugar, which score orange and green on the traffic-light food labelling system. They contain 67%-70% turkey meat and no E-numbers.\n\nBernard Matthews, which is now owned by the 2 Sisters Food Group, will announce on Monday the so-called \u201ccomeback of the century\u201d, following hints posted on social media. The company said the return of Twizzlers was a response to consumer demand. A Change.org petition in 2018 attracted more than 27,700 signatures from people calling for them to be reintroduced into supermarket freezers.\n\nThe new-style Twizzlers will go on sale in branches of Iceland from Thursday, followed by other supermarkets in the near future. Teasingly, a 3 metre-high Turkey Twizzler statue was unveiled this weekend at the company\u2019s headquarters, Great Witchingham Hall, in Norwich. The original Twizzler-making machines have been recommissioned to make the new products.\n\nThe 2005 television programme Jamie\u2019s School Dinners , which aimed to spark a \u201cschool dinner revolution\u201d, triggered a national debate about the quality of school food, demonising Turkey Twizzlers and prompting ministers to instigate a new standard for all schools. In relation to their 34% turkey meat content, Oliver said at the time: \u201cThe prospect of what else is in them isn\u2019t particularly good.\u201d\n\nJames Toop, the chief executive of Bite Back 2030, a youth-led organisation campaigning for a healthier food system and co-founded by Oliver, said: \u201cCovid-19 has brought the importance of a healthy diet into sharp focus for us all. Companies should be doing everything they can to prioritise child health. Any brand that chooses now to relaunch an HFSS product [high in fat, salt and\/or sugar] should be questioning their organisational values.\u201d\n\nBarbara Crowther of the Children\u2019s Food Campaign said: \u201cThe fact it\u2019s taken Bernard Matthews 15 years to reformulate the Turkey Twizzler shows what a truly terrible product it used to be. Doubling the turkey content still only takes it to 67-70% meat content, and while it\u2019s a healthier version of its former self, it remains an ultra-processed product.\n\n\u201cWe recommend sticking to fresh, whole, free-range and\/or organic turkey, low-fat, high in protein and with no added sugars at all.\u201d"},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/business\/companies\/tech-rally-elevates-nasdaq-to-record-high-20200818-p55mo6.html","domain":"smh.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-17 19:41:00","title":"Nasdaq posts record close as tech stocks shine","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.ffx.io\/images\/$zoom_0.184%2C$multiply_0.5855%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0\/t_crop_custom\/q_86%2Cf_auto\/9072915b7f2e79da5a534bdac36d6f2b8e9a8c43","content":"The Nasdaq surged to a record high close on Monday (US time), while the S&P 500 approached its own record level, with both indexes lifted by Nvidia and other technology stocks.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 reached just shy of its February 19 intraday record high after testing that level for much of last week, while the Dow Jones was weighed down by losses in financial and industrial stocks.\n\nThe Nasdaq and S&P 500 made strong gains to start the week.

Currently, the number of turbofan aircraft in the world are more than any of the other commercial aircraft types. Their use is being popularized by virtue of the advantages they offer, like their efficiency at high speeds and high altitudes. Most airliners today use turbofan engines, as they are efficient for long duration, long haul flights. The segment is also expected to show high growth rate during the forecast, as the procurement of turbofan aircraft is more compared to the aircraft operating with other engine types.\n\n\n\nAsia-Pacific to Dominate the Market During the Forecast Period\n\n\n\nPresently, Asia-Pacific has the highest market share among all the regions, due to a large number of aircraft procurement in the region. The growth in air passenger traffic is predominant in the region, and China and India are expected to be among the biggest aviation markets in the world, by the end of the period studied. Procurement of new generation commercial aircraft and the introduction of routes, even by the airlines of other countries in the region, are currently being taking place in the market. The aforementioned factors are expected to make the Asia-Pacific region register a high CAGR.\n\n\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n\n\n\n3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n\n\n4 MARKET DYNAMICS\n\n4.1 Market Overview\n\n4.2 Market Drivers\n\n4.3 Market Restraints\n\n4.4 Porter's Five Forces Analysis\n\n4.4.1 Threat of New Entrants\n\n4.4.2 Bargaining Power of Buyers\/Consumers\n\n4.4.3 Bargaining Power of Suppliers\n\n4.4.4 Threat of Substitute Products\n\n4.4.5 Intensity of Competitive Rivalry\n\n\n\n5 MARKET SEGMENTATION\n\n5.1 Aircraft Type\n\n5.1.1 Fixed-wing aircraft\n\n5.1.1.1 Narrow-body\n\n5.1.1.2 Wide-body\n\n5.1.1.3 Regional\n\n5.1.1.4 Freighter\n\n5.1.2 Rotorcraft\n\n5.2 Engine Type\n\n5.2.1 Turbofan\n\n5.2.2 Turboprop\n\n5.2.3 Turboshaft\n\n5.3 Carrier Type\n\n5.3.1 Full Service Carriers\n\n5.3.2 Low-cost Carriers\n\n5.4 Geography\n\n5.4.1 North America\n\n5.4.1.1 United States\n\n5.4.1.2 Canada\n\n5.4.2 Europe\n\n5.4.2.1 United Kingdom\n\n5.4.2.2 France\n\n5.4.2.3 Germany\n\n5.4.2.4 Italy\n\n5.4.2.5 Rest of Europe\n\n5.4.3 Asia-Pacific\n\n5.4.3.1 China\n\n5.4.3.2 India\n\n5.4.3.3 Japan\n\n5.4.3.4 South Korea\n\n5.4.3.5 Australia\n\n5.4.3.6 Rest of Asia-Pacific\n\n5.4.4 Latin America\n\n5.4.4.1 Mexico\n\n5.4.4.2 Brazil\n\n5.4.5 Middle-East and Africa\n\n5.4.5.1 Saudi Arabia\n\n5.4.5.2 United Arab Emirates\n\n5.4.5.3 Qatar\n\n5.4.5.4 South Africa\n\n5.4.5.5 Rest of Middle-East and Africa\n\n\n\n6 COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE\n\n6.1 Vendor Market Share\n\n6.2 Company Profiles\n\n\n\n7 MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND FUTURE TRENDS\n\n\n\nFor more information about this report visit https:\/\/www.researchandmarkets.com\/r\/gfbq7r."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/719893\/tiktok-crackdown-devastate-app-us\/","domain":"cultofmac.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 15:00:00","title":"Trump's TikTok crackdown would devastate video-sharing app in the US","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/TikTok-investigation-1536x1024.jpg","content":"The plan for implementing President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order targeting TikTok reportedly would take a two-pronged approach that could cripple the wildly popular app in the United States.\n\nThe executive order could ban TikTok from Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores, effectively stopping the video-sharing app\u2019s wildfire growth. (The app has \u201creportedly been downloaded over 175 million times in the United States and over one billion times globally,\u201d according to Trump\u2019s executive order.)

Some advertisers told Reuters they were drafting contingency plans and considering other apps for their marketing.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s high-profile battle with TikTok, fueled by allegations that the app acts as spyware, reportedly would end if Microsoft buys TikTok as rumored. Bringing the Chinese-owned app under the control of a U.S. company supposedly would resolve security concerns about the app.\n\nHowever, TikTok already says it holds U.S. user data in the United States and Singapore. It stresses that it does not pass on information to the Chinese government.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the TikTok app \u201cskirted a privacy safeguard in Google\u2019s Android operating system to collect unique identifiers from millions of mobile devices.\u201d The paper said the tactic \u201callows the app to track users online without allowing them to opt out.\u201d (Apparently the iOS version is not affected.)\n\nThe rise and \u2026 rise of TikTok?\n\nTrump threatened to ban TikTok from the United States if Beijing-based owner ByteDance doesn\u2019t sell the app by September. The first anyone heard of this issue was in early July, when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the White House was looking closely at the matter. Asked if people should download TikTok, Pompeo said, \u201cOnly if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nDespite this turmoil, TikTok remains immensely popular with users. It ruled as the No. 1 app on both iOS and the Google Play app stores last month. However, the 65.3 million July installs was a drop from previous months. Meanwhile, rival apps have grown in popularity."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/auto.hindustantimes.com\/auto\/two-wheelers\/harley-davidson-street-750-receives-a-massive-price-cut-in-india-41596803474959.html","domain":"auto.hindustantimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 13:25:56","title":"Harley-Davidson Street 750 receives a massive price cut in India","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/auto.hindustantimes.com\/auto\/images\/static-images\/png\/ht-auto-logo@3x.png","content":"As Harley-Davidson restructures strategy that shifts focus back to more profitable motorcycles and core markets, the company on Friday announced a price cut on its entry-level Street 750 motorcycle.\n\nThe bike is now priced at \u20b94.69 lakh (Vivid Black colour option) which is a direct reduction of \u20b965,000 against its previous cost of \u20b95.34 lakh.

Evrysdi showed clinically-meaningful improvements in motor function across two clinical trials in people with varying ages and levels of disease severity, including Types 1, 2, and 3 SMA. Infants achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds, a key motor milestone not normally seen in the natural course of the disease. Evrysdi also improved survival without permanent ventilation at 12 and 23 months, compared to natural history. A liquid medicine, Evrysdi is administered daily at home by mouth or feeding tube.\n\n\u201cGiven the majority of people with SMA in the U.S. remain untreated, we believe Evrysdi, with its favorable clinical profile and oral administration, may offer meaningful benefits for many living with this rare neurological disease,\u201d said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer and head of Global Product Development. \u201cThe strength and resolve of the SMA community has continually inspired us as we developed this first-of-its-kind medicine for SMA, so today we celebrate our collective accomplishment together with them.\u201d\n\nEvrysdi is being studied in more than 450 people as part of a large and robust clinical trial program in SMA. The program includes infants aged 2 months to adults aged 60 with varying symptoms and motor function, such as people with scoliosis or joint contractures, and those previously treated for SMA with another medication. The approval is based on data from two clinical studies designed to represent a broad spectrum of people living with SMA: FIREFISH in symptomatic infants aged 2 to 7 months; and SUNFISH in children and adults aged 2 to 25 years. SUNFISH is the first and only placebo-controlled trial to include adults with Types 2 and 3 SMA.\n\nIn FIREFISH, 41% (7\/17) of infants treated with the therapeutic dose achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition (BSID-III). Additionally, 90% (19\/21) of infants were alive without permanent ventilation at 12 months of treatment and reached 15 months of age or older. As described in the natural history of untreated infantile-onset SMA, infants would not be expected to be able to sit independently, and only 25% would be expected to survive without permanent ventilation beyond 14 months of age. In SUNFISH, children and adults treated with Evrysdi experienced a clinically-meaningful and statistically-significant improvement in motor function at 12 months (1.55 point mean difference; p=0.0156) compared to placebo (1.36 points [95% CI: 0.61, 2.11]; -0.19 points [95% CI: -1.22, 0.84], respectively), as measured by a change from baseline in the Motor Function Measure-32 (MFM-32) total score.\n\nEvrysdi demonstrated a favorable efficacy and safety profile, with the safety profile established across the FIREFISH and SUNFISH trials. The most common adverse reactions were fever, diarrhea, and rash in later-onset SMA. In infantile-onset SMA, the most common adverse events were similar and also included upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, and vomiting. There were no treatment-related safety findings leading to withdrawal from either study.\n\n\u201cThroughout their lives, many people with SMA may lose their ability to perform critical movements, which can impact the ability to independently participate in aspects of daily life and even be life altering,\u201d said Kenneth Hobby, president of Cure SMA. \u201cThe approval of Evrysdi is an eagerly awaited milestone for our community. We appreciate Genentech\u2019s commitment to reflecting the full scope of the real-world SMA population in their clinical trial program and developing a treatment that can be administered at home.\u201d\n\nEvrysdi is designed to treat SMA by increasing production of the survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMN protein is found throughout the body and is critical for maintaining healthy motor neurons and movement. Genentech leads the clinical development of Evrysdi as part of a collaboration with the SMA Foundation and PTC Therapeutics.\n\nEvrysdi will be available in the United States within two weeks for direct delivery to patients\u2019 homes through Accredo Health Group Inc., an Express Scripts specialty pharmacy.\n\nGenentech is committed to helping patients access the medicines prescribed by their physician. For people with SMA, the MySMA Support program team is available to answer questions, provide product education and help families understand insurance coverage and navigate appropriate financial assistance options to start and stay on Evrysdi. Patients can call 1-833-EVRYSDI or visit http:\/\/www.Evrysdi.com or https:\/\/www.Genentech-Access.com to learn more.\n\nAbout Evrysdi\u2122 (risdiplam)\n\nEvrysdi is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier designed to treat SMA caused by mutations in chromosome 5q that lead to SMN protein deficiency. Evrysdi is administered daily at home in liquid form by mouth or by feeding tube.\n\nRisdiplam was granted PRIME designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 and Orphan Drug Designation by FDA and EMA in 2017 and 2019, respectively. At this time, risdiplam has been filed in Brazil, Chile, China, Indonesia, Russia, South Korea, and Taiwan. A Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission to the EMA for Evrysdi is imminent.\n\nAbout the Pivotal Studies\n\nFIREFISH (NCT02913482)\n\nFIREFISH, an open-label, two-part pivotal study, was designed to assess Evrysdi safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in patients aged 1 to 7 months with Type 1 SMA. Part 1 evaluated several doses of Evrysdi and determined the therapeutic dose of 0.2 mg\/kg for Part 2. In Part 1, after 12 months of Evrysdi treatment:\n\n41% (7\/17) of infants treated with the therapeutic dose achieved the ability to sit without support for at least 5 seconds as measured by the BSID-III gross motor scale.\n\n90% (19\/21) of all infants were alive without permanent ventilation* and reached 15 months of age or older.\n\n81% (17\/21) of all patients were alive without permanent ventilation* after a minimum of 23 months of treatment and reached an age of 28 months or older (median 32 months; range 28 to 45 months).\n\n*Permanent ventilation defined as tracheostomy or \u226516 hours of non-invasive ventilation per day or intubation for \u226521 consecutive days in the absence of, or following the resolution of, an acute reversible event.\n\nSUNFISH (NCT02908685)\n\nSUNFISH, a two-part placebo-controlled multicenter pivotal trial, was designed to assess Evrysdi safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and PD in people with Type 2 or 3 SMA aged 2 to 25, including those with scoliosis (67% in Part 2) and joint contractures at baseline. In Part 2, after 12 months, Evrysdi treatment led to:\n\nA clinically-meaningful and statistically significant improvement in motor function among children and adults, as measured by a change from baseline in the MFM-32 total score (1.55 point mean difference; p=0.0156), at 12 months as compared to placebo (1.36 points [95% CI: 0.61, 2.11]; -0.19 points [95% CI: 1.22, 0.84], respectively). MFM-32 assesses 32 different motor functions across a wide range of people with SMA.\n\nclinically-meaningful and statistically significant improvement in motor function among children and adults, as measured by a change from baseline in the MFM-32 total score (1.55 point mean difference; p=0.0156), at 12 months as compared to placebo (1.36 points [95% CI: 0.61, 2.11]; -0.19 points [95% CI: 1.22, 0.84], respectively). MFM-32 assesses 32 different motor functions across a wide range of people with SMA. Improved upper limb motor function compared to baseline, as measured by the Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM), a secondary independent motor function endpoint of the study (1.59 point difference; p=0.0028).\n\nPivotal Trial Safety Data\n\nThe safety profile of Evrysdi was established across the FIREFISH and SUNFISH pivotal trials. The most common adverse reactions in later-onset SMA (incidence of at least 10% of patients treated with Evrysdi and more frequently than control) were fever, diarrhea, and rash. The most common adverse reactions in infantile-onset SMA were similar to those observed in later-onset SMA patients. Additionally, the most common adverse reactions (incidence of at least 10%) were upper respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, constipation, and vomiting.\n\nAbout the Evrysdi Clinical Trial Program\n\nIn addition to FIREFISH and SUNFISH, Evrysdi is being evaluated in a broad range of people with SMA, including in:\n\nJEWELFISH (NCT03032172): an open-label exploratory trial designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) in people with SMA aged 6 months to 60 years who received other investigational or approved SMA therapies for at least 90 days prior to receiving Evrysdi. Recruitment for this study is complete with 174 people enrolled.\n\nRAINBOWFISH (NCT03779334): an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study investigating the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Evrysdi in infants (~n=25), from birth to six weeks of age (at first dose) with genetically diagnosed SMA who are not yet presenting with symptoms. The study is currently recruiting.\n\nAbout SMA\n\nSMA is a severe, progressive neuromuscular disease that can be fatal. It affects approximately one in 10,000 babies and is the leading genetic cause of infant mortality. SMA is caused by a mutation of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to a deficiency of SMN protein. This protein is found throughout the body and is essential to the function of nerves that control muscles and movement. Without it, nerve cells cannot function correctly, leading to muscle weakness over time. Depending on the type of SMA, an individual\u2019s physical strength and their ability to walk, eat or breathe can be significantly diminished or lost.\n\nWhat is Evrysdi?\n\nEvrysdi is a prescription medicine used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in adults and children 2 months of age and older.\n\nIt is not known if Evrysdi is safe and effective in children under 2 months of age.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nBefore taking Evrysdi, patients should tell their healthcare provider about all of their medical conditions, including if they: have liver problems are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rodney Sacks, Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for attending this call. I'm Rodney Sacks. Hilton Schlosberg, our Vice Chairman and President, is on the call; as is Tom Kelly, our Executive Vice President of Finance. Tom Kelly will now read our cautionary announcement.\n\nThomas J. Kelly -- Senior Vice President-Finance\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are based on currently available information regarding the expectations of management with respect to revenues, profitability, future business, future events, financial performance and trends as well as the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's business and operations. Management cautions that these statements are based on our current knowledge and expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the control of the company that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made during this call.\n\nPlease refer to our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed on February 28, 2020, and our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on May 11, 2020, including the sections contained therein, entitled Risk Factors and forward-looking Statements for a discussion on specific risks and uncertainties that may affect our performance. The company assumes no obligations to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes and designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated August 4, 2020. A copy of this information is also available on our website, www.monsterbevcorp.com, in the Financial Information section.\n\nI would now like to hand the call over to Rodney Sacks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nLet me begin by stating that our thoughts and prayers are with all who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our top priority has been the health, safety and well-being of our employees. As mentioned on our previous call, in early March 2020, we implemented global travel restrictions and work-from-home policies for employees who are able to work remotely. For those employees who are unable to work remotely, safety precautions have been instituted which were developed and adopted in line with guidance from public health authorities and professional consultants. Our offices have partially reopened in the United States and in certain countries, and our field sales teams are operating in the field with our bottlers, distributors and retailers, subject to safety protocols.\n\nWe are incredibly proud of the teamwork exhibited by our employees, co-packers, and bottlers and distributors around the world who are ensuring the integrity of our supply chain. Our flavor manufacturing facilities, our co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities are all operating. Certain of our bottlers and distributors have implemented modifications to their core points and service levels. But generally, our products remain available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of our bottlers and distributors have been more affected. The COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our net and gross sales for the 2020 second quarter in part due to certain of our bottlers and distributors reducing their inventory levels. However, we did see a sequential improvement in sales in the latter half of the quarter as certain countries and states began to gradually reopen.\n\nSince mid-March 2020, the company has seen a shift in consumer channel preferences and package configurations, including an increase in at-home consumption and a decrease in immediate consumption. Our sales in the second quarter were initially adversely affected as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and gas channel, which is our largest channel, but improved sequentially throughout the quarter. Our e-commerce, club store, mass merchandiser and grocery and related business continued to increase in the quarter while our foodservice on-premise business, which is a small channel for us, remains challenged. Currently, we do not foresee a material impact on the ability of our co-packers to manufacture and our bottlers and distributors to distribute our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition, we are not experiencing raw material or finished product shortages in our supply chain. Monster Energy Cares, our philanthropic arm, continues to be actively engaged in a number of philanthropic efforts, including donating products to individuals working on the front lines, such as first responders, healthcare workers, hospitals and the National Guard. Based on currently available information, we do not expect the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our liquidity. In the second quarter of 2020, net sales were $1.09 billion compared with $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2019. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2020 second quarter would have been up approximately 1%. The COVID-19 pandemic's impact was more pronounced in EMEA during the quarter.\n\nIn particular, the reduction in revenue from our Strategic Brands segment was significant as our larger revenue-generating countries in EMEA experienced extended lockdowns. Operating income was $407.3 million, up from $379 million in the second quarter of 2019, due in part to lower sponsorship and endorsement costs of $19.8 million as well as lower travel and entertainment expenses of $10.1 million. The cost for certain postponed or rescheduled events have been, or may be, deferred to future periods. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate in which future periods, if any, such deferred sponsorship and endorsement costs will be recognized. Net income increased 6.5% to $311.4 million as compared to $292.5 million in the 2019 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2020 second quarter increased 9.9% to $0.59 from $0.53 in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nAccording to the Nielsen reports, for the 13 weeks through July 18, 2020, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 7.6% versus the same period a year ago.

Bang's share decreased 1.3 points to 7.2%.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, for the four weeks ended July 18, 2020, sales in dollars in the coffee plus energy drink category, which includes our Java Monster line in the convenience and gas channel increased 10.2% over the same period the previous year. Sales of Java Monster were 24.6% higher in the same period versus the previous year. Sales of Starbucks Energy were 12.3% higher. Java Monster share of the coffee plus energy category, which primarily includes Java Monster, Java Monster 300, Starbucks Doubleshot and Tripleshot, Rockstar Roasted and Bang Keto Coffee for the four weeks ended July 18, 2020, was 51.1%, up 5.9 points, while Starbucks Energy share was 47%, up 0.8 points. Cafe Monster and Espresso Monster have been discontinued in the United States. According to Stackline, which tracks energy drink sales by Amazon in the United States, for the 4-week period ending July 18, 2020, sales in dollars in the energy category by Amazon, including energy shots, increased 190% over the same period the previous year.\n\nSales of Monster increased 269.4% and its share was 39.5%, up 8.5 share points versus the same period a year ago. Red Bull sales increased 172.4% and its share was 14.5%, down 0.9 of a point. CELSIUS' sales increased 213% and its share increased 0.8 of a point to 11.3%. And 5-hour sales increased 50.5%, and its share declined 3.8 points to 4.2%. VPX Bang's sales increased 66.1% and its share declined 2.7 share points to 3.7%. Reign's share was 5.5% and Rockstar share was 1.7%. According to Nielsen, in all measured channels in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 13, 2020, the energy drink category increased 6.8% in dollars. Sales of the company's energy drink brands increased 6.9% versus a year ago. The market share of the company's energy drink brands was 37.8%, the same as in the previous year. Monster's market share increased 0.2 of a point to 34.9%. NOS' sales increased 7.6%, and its market share remained the same at 2.1%.\n\nFull Throttle's sales decreased 21.2%, and its market share decreased 0.3 of a point to 0.7%. Red Bull's sales increased 11.1%, and its market share increased 1.5 points to 38.1%. Rockstar's sales decreased 5.2% and its market share decreased 2.1 points to 16%. Guru's sales increased 35.7%, and its share increased 0.7 of a share point to 3.2%. According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category declined 11.8% for the month of June 2020. Monster sales decreased 18.9%. Our market share in value decreased 2.4 points to 27.8% against the comparable period the previous year. Burn has been discontinued in Mexico.

Vault sales increased 0.2 of a percent and its market share increased 2.2 share points to 18.8%, while Boost sales decreased 10.7% and its market share increased 0.1 of a point to 7.4%.\n\nAmper sales increased 269% and its market share increased 7.5 points to 13.6%. Coca-Cola Energy's market share was 0.9 of a percentage point. Predator, which was launched in March 2020, achieved a market share of 1.4%. The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of June 2020 compared to June 2019, Monster's retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 25.4% to 39.4%; in Brazil, from 21.1% to 30.4%; and in Chile, from 37.4% to 44.9%. Since the launch of Monster Energy in Argentina, in the first quarter of 2018, Monster is now the leading energy brand in volume in Argentina.\n\nI would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended mid-June 2020, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 22.1% to 25.6% in Denmark, grew from 20.8% to 24.8% in Great Britain, grew from 24.2% to 28.4% in Norway, grew from 21.9% to 24.9% in the Republic of Ireland, grew from 32.2% to 34.8% in Spain, and grew from 12.8% to 13.8% in Sweden; but declined from 13.1% to 12.5% in Belgium, from 27% to 25.9% in France, and from 7.4% to 6.3% in the Netherlands.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, in the 13-week period to the end of May 2020, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period of previous year grew from 34.7% to 35.2% in Greece, from 13.7% to 17.7% in Poland, from 16.4% to 17.7% in South Africa; while it remained flat at 13.3% in the Czech Republic; and declined from 16% to 15.1% in Germany and from 18.5% to 16.8% in Italy. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country. According to IRI in Australia, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended July 5, 2020 increased from 9.4% to 11.9% as compared to the same period the previous year. Mother's market share in value decreased from 13.9% to 13.3% during the same period. Market share of the company's brands in Australia for the four weeks ended July 5, 2020 increased from 23.3% to 25.2%.\n\nAccording to IRI in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value for the four weeks ended June 21, 2020 increased from 7.8% to 10.4% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+ market share in value decreased from 8.3% to 7.1%, and Mother's market share in value decreased from 6.5% to 6.4%. Market share of the company's brands in New Zealand for the four weeks ended June 21, 2020 increased from 22.6% to 23.8%. According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monster's market share value in all outlets combined for the month ending June 2020 grew from 39.4% to 53.3% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE, in Japan, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of June 2020 declined from 52.5% to 51.1% as compared to the same period in the previous year.\n\nWe again point out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and\/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods. Net sales to customers outside the U.S. were $328.3 million, 30% of total net sales in the 2020 second quarter compared to $343.3 million or 31.1% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2019. The decrease was largely due to the reduction of sales in EMEA during the quarter. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of decreasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $18.2 million in the 2020 second quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. In EMEA, net sales in the second quarter decreased 20.4% in dollars and decreased 15.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 38.1% compared to 39.5% in the same quarter in 2019.\n\nGross profit percentage for the region was adversely impacted by foreign exchange rates, country and product mix. In local currencies, gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the quarter was 39.4%. The COVID-19 pandemic's adverse impact on net sales was more pronounced in EMEA for the three months ended June 30, 2020, particularly in the Strategic Brands segment. Net sales in EMEA were also adversely impacted by the reduction in inventories by certain of our bottlers and distributors. In addition, to a lesser extent, the trading dispute between Coca-Cola bottlers and the European buying group, primarily in Western Europe, resulted in the temporary delisting of some Coca-Cola and Monster products, which had an adverse impact on net sales in EMEA for the three months ended June 30, 2020.\n\nWe are pleased that in the second quarter, Monster gained market share in Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Norway, Poland, Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. In Asia Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 30.4% in dollars and 30.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 43.3% versus 43.6% over the same period in 2019. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 41.8% in dollars and 37.5% in local currency. In South Korea, net sales increased 46.9% in dollars and 55.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In China, net sales increased 66.9% in dollars in the quarter and 74.4% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019. In Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Guam, net sales decreased 32.3% in dollars and 24.9% in local currencies.\n\nSales of the Monster brand decreased 25.6% in dollars and 17.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter in 2019 while the strategic brands in this region decreased at a faster rate. Net sales in this region were adversely affected as a result of our bottlers, distributors reducing their inventory levels. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the second quarter decreased 9.7% in dollars and increased 10.8% in local currencies gross profit over the same period in 2019. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 41.2% compared to 43.3% over the same period in 2019. In Brazil, net sales in the quarter decreased by 1% in dollars but increased 31.2% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 30.8% in dollars and 62.3% in local currency in the quarter.\n\nI will now briefly discuss our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., VPX, the maker of Bang Energy drinks. Several proceedings are currently ongoing with VPX, including claims for false advertising and trademark and trade dress infringement brought by the company against VPX and by VPX against the company. The company's lawsuit for unfair competition, false advertising and misappropriation of trade secrets is scheduled for trial in April 2021. VPX' lawsuit against the company in which VPX claimed trademark infringement of their newly acquired Reign trademark and the company counterclaimed for cancellation of their trademark. The district court judge ruled in the company's favor in respect of the trademark infringement claims, finding that the company had superior rights to the Reign trademark in connection with energy drinks and canceling the Reign trademark that VPX had purchased.\n\nVPX remains enjoined from selling rain branded energy drinks. VPX' trade dress infringement claims in these proceedings are scheduled for trial at the end of August 2020. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on today's call. In the United States, our bottlers focused on relaunching our first quarter product innovation, which plans were disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Canada, we did not launch any new items within the second quarter of 2020 and continue to grow our distribution of all first quarter 2020 innovations. In Honduras, we launched Fury, Gold Strike in the affordable energy category during April 2020, and in Salvador in early July 2020.\n\nInitial results have been positive. In June 2020, we launched Ultra Paradise in Argentina and in Puerto Rico. Additionally, in June 2020, we launched Monster Mango Loco in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. In New Zealand, we launched Monster Energy Mule and Mother Tropical Blast during April 2020. Despite a lockdown in the majority of EMEA markets for most of the second quarter, we have still been able to introduce new products across EMEA. Juice Monster Pacific Punch was launched in Spain in June 2020 and is now available in 10 markets across EMEA and we plan to launch Juice Monster Pacific Punch in an additional two markets in 2020. Juice Monster Pipeline Punch was launched in Romania in May 2020 and is now available in 21 markets across EMEA and we plan to launch Juice Monster Pipeline Punch in an additional eight markets in 2020.\n\nJuice Monster Mango Loco was launched in Switzerland in June 2020 and is now available in 35 markets across EMEA. We plan to launch Juice Monster Mango Loco in an additional 10 markets in 2020. Monster Ultra Paradise was launched in Austria, the Baltics and Hungary in May 2020; in Denmark and Spain, in June 2020; in Poland, in July 2020; and is now available in 14 EMEA markets, and we plan to launch Monster Ultra Paradise in an additional seven markets in 2020. Espresso Monster milk and vanilla variants are now available in 20 markets in EMEA, and we plan to launch Espresso Monster milk and vanilla variance in an additional two markets in 2020. And Monster Hydro Sport was launched in Spain in May 2020, and we plan to launch Monster Hydro Sport in an additional market in 2020. We're also pleased with the performance of Reign and we plan to launch Reign in an additional six markets in 2020.\n\nWe launched Monster Mule in Poland in July 2020 and plan to launch Monster Mule in an additional nine markets in 2020. We launched Predator, our primary affordable energy brand, in Nigeria in June 2020. Additionally, we are planning to launch Predator in Ethiopia in the third quarter of 2020. We are also planning to launch Predator in an additional six EMEA markets later in 2020: Bosnia, Croatia, Ghana, Romania, Russia and Slovenia. Currently innovation launches for all EMEA markets for the third and fourth quarters remain on track despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, these launches will continue to be subject to developments in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in individual countries.\n\nIn Japan, we continued with the strong rollout of Pipeline Punch to 90% of the country. And in June launched Ultra Paradise with solid consumer acceptance. With strong innovation and continued growth of our core, we have further built on our number one country share position in value. In South Korea, Monster Energy retained its number one share position in value and in June began shipments for the summer 2020 launch of Ultra Paradise. In April 2020, we began distribution of our new Monster Energy Dragon Tea in China, which is noncarbonated. Early feedback from consumers has been positive. During this quarter, we began shipments for our summer on-pack promotion, and we expect to further build momentum with consumers in the retail trade. India remains mostly in national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which took effect on March 25, 2020. We have prepared a strong summer on-pack promotion, which should help reestablish momentum as the market aims to reopen in the third quarter of 2020.\n\nDuring the 2020 second quarter, we purchased approximately 0.3 million shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $52.88 per share for a total amount of $15.6 million, excluding broker commissions. As of August 4, 2020 approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate July 2020 gross sales to be approximately 15.8% higher than in July 2019. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, July 2020 gross sales would have been approximately 17.1% higher than comparable July 2019 gross sales. July 2020 had the same number of selling days as July 2019.\n\nIn this regard, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances, where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic remains a serious concern. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related and favorable economic conditions continue to intensify, the negative impact on our sales, including our new product innovation launches, could be prolonged and may become more severe.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points: one, the company's priority has been and remains the health and safety of our employees; two, currently, the company's flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating; three, we are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio; four, we are encouraged by the prospects for our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks and Reign Inferno thermogenic fuel high-performance energy drinks.We are planning for future launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in certain countries outside of the U.S.; five, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans for future launches of our affordable energy brands outside of the United States; six, despite the obstacles of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased with our performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year.\n\nI'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nAndrea Teixeira -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\n\nThank you. And I hope you're well Congrats on the results. So I remember you spoke to potentially enter the alcoholic segment the last time we were there at your headquarters in June last year. And since then, we have heard you're planning to launch a hard seltzer. So I understand that you have postponed some of these launches. So the question is, if you are indeed looking to launch a hard seltzer? And then if so, when are you hoping to be able to share more news with us?\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nAndrea, I think the issue is, there's been a lot of speculation about what we are going to do both in the nonalcoholic and alcoholic spaces. We are looking at a number of alternatives and opportunities. And we may well do something in both of those spaces and or one or the other, but we've not made any final decisions. We are actually analyzing it. We're looking at developing some products in both nonalcoholic and alcoholic spaces. We're testing products, but we haven't yet decided on which of those we're going to go into.\n\nWe have, for example, I know that some of the analysts have picked up that we've registered different names of products. Some of those names may be appropriate for one or more of these lines or may not be. We are looking obviously, as part of our planning, we are looking at availability of names that we think may be appropriate for lines or line extensions outside of the energy category. And in some cases, some of those names may well be used by us for an alternative brand within the energy space. I mean, it's a very broad spectrum that we are currently investigating. We've got the right to do quite a lot. We are looking at how do we do it, what's best? What do we think will have the most impact for the company in the short term, both in the U.S. and as well as internationally.\n\nSo there's been a lot of speculation, and we are definitely looking at it and evaluating it, but we've not made any decisions. So at this point, it is premature for us to give any indication to the market of what our plans are because we have not firmed up our plans internally ourselves yet. There's been no definitive decision on when to launch, what to launch and under what brand names. Obviously, we're getting there. We're quite close, but we haven't got to that decision yet. So I really can't give you an update other than to tell you that we are seriously looking at all those options. As I said, there are a lot of speculation about what we're going to do because of the names and the trademarks we've applied to register in the different classes, but that is something that we are currently evaluating.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg -- Vice Chairman, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer & Secretary\n\nSo Andrea, the only thing I would add to that is that we have a very strong innovation pipeline with our existing business. So whatever we do, in addition to that, please rest assured that the company has a very interesting and very strong innovation pipeline.\n\nAndrea Teixeira -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nNik Modi -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nYeah, good afternoon, everyone.So I guess, kind of 1.5 questions. One question is on innovation. Just given how the resets have been kind of thrown off-kilter. I'm just and MAXX is now canceled. I'm just curious on how you're thinking about communicating new product ideas and how you think that flow will work as we kind of work into the fall and into the spring of next year. So that's just kind of get some general perspective. The real question is on CBD, what's the company's stance right now on that? I mean, is it you don't have enough clarity, so really don't want to enter that category? Or do you feel more comfortable now? I mean just any perspective around that would be helpful.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg -- Vice Chairman, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer & Secretary\n\nOkay. So on the first question, we have a sales organization who, in the U.S., call on every single major customer. And that's how we go about presenting new product ideas on a one-to-one basis. So rest assured that innovation can be handled within the framework of our existing organization. Outside and in particular, in Europe and in other parts of the world, the Coca-Cola bottlers present to customers with our attendance, and they're very capable, and they do display new products and new product innovations. On your second point, the environment is actually not clear as to where we are and where we should be with CBD. So at this time, we have products in development, but we it's something that we're looking at from the sidelines. And if things clear up and there are opportunities that will present themselves, it's something that we definitely will look at going forward, but not right now.\n\nNik Modi -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Galbo -- Bank of America -- Analyst\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask on the July sales increase, Rodney, you mentioned that bottlers had taken down inventories pretty low in the second quarter. Just how should we look at that July increase, I guess, from an organic demand improvement standpoint versus bottlers may be reselling some of the pipeline after getting inventory down so low?\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nI don't think we've really had a good read yet on where the bottlers have when they're going to sort of get their inventory levels back to previous or pre-COVID levels, if they do. I mean, people are obviously looking at managing their inventory levels as tightly as they can. And by taking things down, they may end up being a little more aggressive. Obviously, we would like them to take some inventory levels up so that they just have more ability to react in the market and because of the for lead time reasons.\n\nSo I don't think that we've seen a major restocking in July. We've just again, I think people are still cautious and they're trying to manage inventories. And in some cases, they're trying to manage or reduce some of their or focus on, is a better way to put it, on their main SKUs. And so some of the smaller SKUs have perhaps suffered a little bit as well during this period. But we think those things will get back to normalizing. But I don't believe we've seen a substantial jump back in inventory levels in July. I think that's sort of reasonably normal trading for us. I don't know, Hilton, if you'd like to add something on that.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg -- Vice Chairman, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer & Secretary\n\nYes. What I'd like to add is that depletions are tracking positive through July. So sales that our bottlers make to retailers are tracking positively. And sure, there will come a time when bottlers will revert to their prior inventories. But remember, they look at forecasts. Some bottlers have cash issues. The bigger bottlers look at sales forecasts that are generated both by their own forecasters and by their computer forecasting models. So they order inventories in accordance with those models. So you remember when we spoke about on the last call, we spoke, April was down, and we had a long and a robust discussion about that, and we spoke about depletions. And looking at this quarter, we've had a strong July, which is consistent with what's happened in the sequential improvement through May. So April, we had that dip that we spoke about on our call; and in May and June, we've had a sequential improvement and we're seeing that sequential improvement through July as well.\n\nPeter Galbo -- Bank of America -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question today comes from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Astrachan -- Stifel -- Analyst\n\nHey guys, good afternoon all as well. I guess, I'm curious on the U.S., I don't know how to diplomatically ask the question, but maybe if you could touch on the engagement of the Coke system, both in terms of selling your legacy products and the new products, the innovation, including the shelf space for those, obviously, it was a little bit of a slower start, and we've seen Red Bull do very well. So maybe just touch on kind of where we are with reengagement, both in legacy as well as innovation, and how you think that should play out if things get back from a blocking and tackling standpoint, the share trends potentially improve and kind of how you think about that?\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg -- Vice Chairman, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer & Secretary\n\nSo Mark, remember, we're coming out of 100-year pandemic, and there's been the bottles have all been operating. And in some cases, the bottlers have been focused on selling the faster-selling items, I think, Rodney mentioned that earlier in the call, and they did not focus on the innovation and the SKUs that not don't move as fast as the faster-selling items. So we've seen that. We've seen some of the bottlers being affected by the employees by COVID. Our people remember who were out of the field until the last month, so they're now back in the field with the appropriate safety protocols. And our people are working our field people are working with the bottlers and the retailers to restore the innovation, that had not been taken place.\n\nSo Red Bull, it's interesting, we've been watching the growth of Red Bull as well. And Monster's growing, you've seen the numbers, and we've spoken about the numbers today. You've heard about the numbers in Nielsen. We are growing much faster than Red Bull in, for example, Amazon. They have their own sales force and their own distribution network. We've been able to execute pretty well in the trade. They had a really good innovation this year called Watermelon, which was pretty popular. So on balance, I think, they probably out-distributed us in terms of displays and other points of purchase on store shelves and on the floors of the stores. And that's something that we're working to pretty aggressively with our field people back in the stores to regain. So that's my kind of summary on where we are and the issue with Red Bull.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nPerhaps I could just again, also just a little bit of color to because I think it's obviously, you've focused on it and some people have been seeing the numbers. I think it comes down to during this period of time, Red Bull really managed their own distribution system, and they have dedicated and very focused personnel. I think when most of the big companies took a step back, particularly with their personnel in the field and their core points and active being active in the market in the smaller markets, convenience and gas, etc. and independent. I think all the bigger companies took their foot off the pedal and looked at protecting their employees and trying to handle the situation.\n\nOur belief is that Red Bull literally was probably the only company that didn't do that and actually had their teams in the fields merchandising and promoting. And when you combine that focus together and just their approach to the COVID pandemic as well as together with the fact that they did have a flavor that resonated and it did it was really well-executed, the introduction of it, and it has really given them that boost. That's really what we think has been the real difference. But those are things that with a bigger company, like the Coke system, where I think they did step back as most other consumer product companies did. I think that will start reversing and they're getting back into the field now. We're getting our team into the field. We also put some of our team out, as Hilton said. We've got to really understand that, and that's what I think has been one of the big reasons. We've got some innovation lined up for the second half of this year, including something in response to their watermelon product, and we will be launching that within the next few weeks.\n\nMark Astrachan -- Stifel -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\n\nLaurent Grandet -- Guggenheim -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning everyone and thanks for the question. So last time we spoke, I mean, you mentioned that because of COVID-19, I mean, retailers, and specifically, the convenience store retailers then reset for most part, I mean, their shelves for the summer. There was a clear focus for you, I mean, to make sure that you were able to implement your new innovation. So just curious, I mean, in all your retailers and convenience store retailers, are they all resetting their shelves and did you gain shelf space for the energy category or the performance energy? And or is there, any additional retailers that need to convert to larger shares? I mean, I know it's late in the summer, but because of COVID-19, I mean, there was some delay, so want to have your take on this.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg -- Vice Chairman, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer & Secretary\n\nYes. A lot of the retailers are merchandised by the bottlers. So even though the space was allocated, they may not have got to merchandise the product at the start of the resets. So where we're at now, as I mentioned, Laurent, that our guys are back in the field, and they're working with the bottlers to ensure that all of our innovation gets the space that has been contractually allocated and just getting away from where we were in the early part of the pandemic, where it was hands-off. And if you look at how the convenience channel has grown and is continuing to grow, I think it's a far cry from where we were in March and April when all of this started.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nBut that being said, I think that it really is a work in progress. I don't think we've got to a point where we could say that it's all everything that was planned is back in line, and everything was achieved. I think it's because it's out of cycle and because of the difficulties just still being faced generally, it is a slower effort. It's being done. It's slow, but it is improving all the time. But I think it's still not where we would like to see it. But hopefully, we will continue to improve as we go through the next few months.\n\nHilton H. Schlosberg -- Vice Chairman, President, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer & Secretary\n\nYes. Sets are done for the most part, but it's the distribution actual physical distribution of the products on those sets, on those shelves that our field teams are working on.\n\nLaurent Grandet -- Guggenheim -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Okay,\n\nOperator\n\nAnd this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rodney Sacks for his final remarks.\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. On behalf of Monster, I would like to thank everyone for their continued interest in the company. We continue to believe in the company and our growth strategy and remain committed to continuing to innovate, develop and differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad; and in particular, expand distribution of our products through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We believe that we will be able to navigate through the challenges ahead as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and hope that this unfortunate situation will resolve itself in the not-too-distant future. We believe that we are well positioned in the energy drink category and continue to be optimistic about our total portfolio of energy drink brands. We hope that you will stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much for your attendance.\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Closing Remarks].\n\nDuration: 52 minutes\n\nCall participants:\n\nRodney Cyril Sacks -- Chairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThomas J.

The reality is that most will fail and we want to be sure that if any one is shown to be effective and safe that we have rights to it.\u201d\n\nMs Bingham said she was \u201creasonably confident\u201d of a vaccine being found that will reduce the severity of coronavirus symptoms and reduce deaths.\n\nThe Government\u2019s latest agreement follows on from 90 million doses in the pipeline under deals with an alliance between the pharmaceutical giants BioNtech and Pfizer, as well as the firm Valneva.\n\nAlok Sharma (Aaron Chown\/PA)\n\nSome 100 million doses of vaccine could come from a vaccine being developed by Oxford University in partnership with AstraZeneca, while a deal has been struck for 60 million doses of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur\u2019s potential Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nThe deals cover four different classes: adenoviral vaccines, mRNA vaccines, inactivated whole virus vaccines and protein adjuvant vaccines.\n\nBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma said: \u201cThe Government\u2019s strategy to build a portfolio of promising vaccine candidates will ensure we have the best chance possible of finding one that works.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s agreements will not only benefit people in the UK but will ensure fair and equitable access of a vaccine around the world, potentially protecting hundreds of millions of lives.\n\n\u201cWhile we are doing everything we can to ensure the British people get access to a successful vaccine as soon as possible, nobody is safe until we are all safe, so global cooperation is absolutely critical if we are to defeat this virus once and for all.\u201d\n\nAlex Harris, the Wellcome Trust\u2019s head of global policy, said while he welcomed Mr Sharma\u2019s statement, it is \u201curgent\u201d that the Government explains how it will ensure fair and equitable access to a vaccine.\n\nMr Harris said: \u201cWithout this clarity, the risk increases that other rich countries will seek to strike similar bilateral deals, potentially securing significant oversupply, leaving insufficient volumes of vaccine for the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cThe Government must take the global lead to ensure any advances to test, treat and prevent Covid-19 are available for all nations, rich and poor, alike.

The coronavirus pandemic ruled out a face-to-face interview and Dr Singh declined a video call.\n\nDuring our exchange, he laid out three steps he believes the government has to take to stem the crisis and restore economic normalcy in the coming years.\n\nFirst, the government should \"ensure people's livelihoods are protected and they have spending power through a significant direct cash assistance\".\n\nSecond, it should make adequate capital available for businesses through \"government-backed credit guarantee programmes\".\n\nThird, it should fix the financial sector through \"institutional autonomy and processes\".\n\nIndia's economy was already in the throes of a slowdown before the beginning of the pandemic - GDP grew at 4.2% in the 2019-20, its slowest pace in nearly a decade. The country is now gradually unlocking its economy after a prolonged and grinding shutdown, but the future looks uncertain as infection numbers rise. On Thursday, India became the third country to pass two million Covid-19 cases.\n\nEconomists have since warned that India's GDP for the 2020-21 financial year is likely to contract sharply, leading to the worst technical recession since the 1970s.\n\nGetty Images Millions of migrant workers and the poor lost their livelihoods during the lockdown\n\n\"I do not want to use words like 'depression' in a cavalier fashion,\" Dr Singh said, but a \"deep and prolonged economic slowdown\" was \"inevitable\".\n\n\"This economic slowdown is caused by a humanitarian crisis. It is important to view this from the prism of sentiments in our society than mere economic numbers and methods,\" he said.\n\nDr Singh pointed to a consensus forming among economists over an economic contraction in India in nominal terms, \"which if it happens, will be the first time in independent India\".\n\n\"I hope the consensus is wrong,\" he said.\n\nIndia locked down early, at the end of March, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Many believe the lockdown was hastily executed and did not anticipate the exodus of millions of out-of-work migrant workers from cities.\n\nDr Singh believes India did what other nations were doing, and \"perhaps a lockdown at that stage was an inevitable choice\".\n\n\"But the government's shock and awe approach to the lockdown has caused tremendous pain to people. The suddenness of the announcement and the stringency of the lockdown were thoughtless and insensitive,\" he said.\n\n\"Public health emergencies such as this are best dealt with locally by local administrators and public health officials, with broad guidelines from the Centre. Perhaps, we should have devolved the Covid-19 battle to the state and local administrations much sooner.\"\n\nPrivate sector investment is at a 15-year low\n\nAs finance minister, 29 years ago, Dr Singh helmed an ambitious economic reform programme in 1991 after a balance of payments crisis nearly plunged India into bankruptcy.\n\nThe 1991 crisis was a domestic crisis induced by global factors, he said. \"But today's economic situation is unprecedented in its ubiquity, scale and depth.\"\n\nNot even during World War Two had the \"whole world shut down in such a synchronised fashion as it is now\", he said.\n\nIn April Narendra Modi's BJP-led government announced a $266bn (\u00a3212bn) stimulus, including a range of liquidity measures and reforms to kickstart the economy. India's central bank also introduced rate cuts and moratoriums on loans.\n\nWith tax receipts plummeting, economists have debated about how a cash-strapped government would be able to get the money to fund direct transfers and provide more capital to ailing banks and credit to businesses.\n\nThe answer, said Dr Singh was borrowing.\n\n\"Higher borrowing is inevitable,\" he said. \"Even if we have to spend an additional 10% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to cater to the military, health and economic challenges, it must be done.\n\nHe acknowledged that it would increase India's debt to GDP ratio, but if borrowing \"can save lives, borders, restore livelihoods and boost economic growth, then its worth it\", he said.\n\n\"We must not be shy of borrowing but we must be prudent on how we use that borrowing,\" he said.\n\nReuters India needs to produce more for its domestic market\n\nIn the past, taking loans from multilateral institutions like the IMF and World Bank have been taken as signs of India's economic weaknesses. But now India could \"borrow from a position of strength, compared to other developing nations,\" Dr Singh said.\n\n\"India's track record as a borrower from multilateral institutions is impeccable, It is not a sign of weakness to borrow from these institutions.\"\n\nMany countries have decided to print money to fund government spending to tide over the ongoing economic crises, and some prominent economists have suggested the same for India. Others have raised fears about excess supply of money leading to inflation.\n\nMonetisation of the fiscal deficit directly by India's central bank used to be norm until the mid 1990s. India, Dr Singh said, had moved away from the practice to bring about \"fiscal discipline, institutional separation from the Reserve Bank of India [central bank] and the government and to curb unhealthy impulses of seemingly free money\".\n\n\"I am aware that the traditional fear of high inflation due to excess money supply is perhaps no longer valid in developed nations,\" he said. \"But for countries such as India, other than costs of institutional autonomy of the central bank, unbridled printing of money can have attendant impacts on currency, trade and imported inflation.\"\n\nDr Singh said he was not ruling out printing money to finance the deficit, but \"merely suggesting that let the barrier for that to be very high and use it as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted\".\n\nHe warned against India following some other nations in becoming more protectionist - imposing high trade barriers duties on imports. India's trade policy over the last three decades had brought \"enormous economic gains to not just the top but across all sections of our population\", he said.\n\nGetty Images India's rising upper middle class has substantial disposable income\n\nAs Asia's third largest economy, India today is in a far stronger position today than in the early 1990s. I asked Dr Singh whether these strengths would help India stage a robust recovery after the pandemic ends.\n\n\"India's real GDP is 10 times stronger than what it was in 1990, and India had lifted more than 300 million people from poverty since then,\" he said. \"So yes, the Indian economy is intrinsically much stronger now.\"\n\nBut a significant driver of that growth was India's trade with the rest of the world. The share of global trade in India's GDP increased nearly fivefold in this period.\n\n\"India is much more integrated with the rest of the world now,\" Dr Singh said. \"Hence, what happens in the global economy will have a significant impact on India's economy. In this pandemic, the global economy is severely dented and that will be a big cause of concern for India.\"\n\nUltimately, no one yet knows the full economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, nor how long nations will take to recover from it. But one thing is clear, it has defied the experience of even seasoned economists like Dr Singh."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/podcast\/coronavirus-essential-podcast-zydus-cadilla-to-start-phase-ii-vaccine-trials-tomorrow-one-covid-19-death-every-15-seconds-says-report-5651331.html","domain":"moneycontrol.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 13:59:00","title":"Coronavirus Essential podcast | Zydus Cadilla to start phase II vaccine trials tomorrow; one COVID-19...","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.moneycontrol.com\/images\/common\/header\/search_cash_reward_0809_400x33.png?impolicy=mchigh","content":"Pharma company Zydus Cadila announced on Wednesday that its coronavirus vaccine named ZyCoV-D was found to be safe in the first trial.

These measures, which include the implementation of travel bans, self-imposed quarantine periods and social distancing, have caused material disruption to businesses globally resulting in an economic slowdown. Governments and central banks have responded with significant monetary and fiscal interventions designed to stabilize economic conditions. Equity markets in particular have been volatile, experiencing material and rapid declines in the first quarter of 2020 followed by recoveries during the second quarter of 2020.\n\nThe Corporation is managing the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic utilizing its existing risk management framework. At Power Corporation and its group companies, the focus has continued to be on managing the safety and well-being of its people, maintaining operational effectiveness, ensuring that the group can serve its customers, assessing impacts on earnings, liquidity and capital, planning for different potential scenarios and engaging with stakeholders. The respective boards of directors of Power Financial, Lifeco, IGM, Pargesa and GBL are responsible for the governance structures and processes to oversee the management of the risk and potential impacts presented by the current economic slowdown and other potential consequences due to COVID-19.\n\nThe duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown at this time. Economic damage and market weakness are being felt across the global economy. Significant economic headwinds are expected to continue in the second half of 2020 as a result of anticipated negative credit experiences, impairment of valuations in certain sectors of the economy and asset classes, and uncertainties in the durability and effectiveness of government and central bank interventions, among others. It is not possible to reliably estimate the length and severity of these developments and the impact on the financial results and condition of the Corporation and its operating subsidiaries in future periods.\n\nDividend on Power Corporation Participating Shares\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of 44.75 cents per share on the Participating Preferred Shares and the Subordinate Voting Shares of the Corporation, payable October 30, 2020 to shareholders of record September 30, 2020.\n\nDividends on Power Corporation Non-Participating Preferred Shares\n\nThe Board of Directors also declared quarterly dividends on the Corporation's preferred shares, payable October 15, 2020 to shareholders of record September 24, 2020:\n\nSeries Stock Symbol Amount\n\nSeries Stock Symbol Amount 1986 Series POW.PR.F Floating rate [1]\n\nSeries C POW.PR.C 36.25\u00a2 Series A POW.PR.A 35\u00a2\n\nSeries D POW.PR.D 31.25\u00a2 Series B POW.PR.B 33.4375\u00a2\n\nSeries G POW.PR.G 35\u00a2\n\n[1] Equal to one quarter of 70% of the average prime rate of two major Canadian chartered banks for the period June 1 to August 31, 2020.\n\nAbout Power Corporation\n\nPower Corporation is an international management and holding company that focuses on financial services in North America, Europe and Asia.

Net asset value is the fair value of the assets of the combined Power Financial and Power Corporation's non-consolidated balance sheet less their net debt and preferred shares. The Corporation's net asset value per share is presented on a look-through basis.\n\nThe Corporation's net asset value per share was $32.96 at June 30, 2020, compared with $30.79 at March 31, 2020, representing an increase of 7.0%. The net asset value per share was $44.98 at December 31, 2019.\n\n(in millions of Canadian dollars, except per share amounts) June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019\n\nCombined non-consolidated balance sheet Fair value adjustment Net asset value Combined non-consolidated balance sheet [1] Fair value adjustment Net asset value Assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Financial [2]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLifeco 13,933 829 14,762 13,654 6,976 20,630 IGM 2,778 2,102 4,880 2,729 2,786 5,515 Parjointco [3] 3,763 (1,223) 2,540 3,954 (1,413) 2,541 Other Power Financial investments 193 134 327 203 127 330 Other investments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSagard Holdings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset management companies [4] 164 \u2212 164 153 \u2212 153 Investments [5] 686 \u2212 686 587 \u2212 587 Power Sustainable Capital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Pacific 850 \u2212 850 739 \u2212 739 Power Energy Corporation 384 349 733 325 320 645 Other 660 199 859 671 223 894 China AMC [6] 687 \u2212 687 658 \u2212 658 Cash and cash equivalents 1,362 \u2212 1,362 1,392 \u2212 1,392 Other assets 337 \u2212 337 360 \u2212 360 Total assets 25,797 2,390 28,187 25,425 9,019 34,444\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiabilities and\n\nnon-participating shares\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebentures and other debt instruments 1,027 \u2212 1,027 933 \u2212 933 Other liabilities [7] 1,083 \u2212 1,083 1,024 \u2212 1,024 Non-participating shares and\n\nperpetual preferred shares 3,788 \u2212 3,788 3,790 \u2212 3,790 Total liabilities and\n\nnon-participating shares 5,898 \u2212 5,898 5,747 \u2212 5,747 Non-controlling interests \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 6,464 3,050 9,514\n\n5,898 \u2212 5,898 12,211 3,050 15,261\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipating shareholders'\n\nequity \/ Net asset value 19,899 2,390 22,289 13,214 5,969 19,183\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer share 29.43\n\n32.96 30.98\n\n44.98\n\n[1] In the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation modified the presentation of the asset management companies held by the investment platforms. For additional information, please refer to the Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Presentation below. [2] Investments held by Power Financial have been presented on a look-through basis at December 31, 2019; the corresponding adjustment representing the ownership not held by Power Corporation is included in non-controlling interests. [3] As part of the Pargesa reorganization, Parjointco holds approximately 90% of Pargesa's shares at June 30, 2020; the fair value of Parjointco at June 30, 2020 is based on the market value of GBL. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of Parjointco based on the market value of GBL was $3,032 million. [4] The management companies of the investment funds are presented at their carrying value in accordance with IFRS. [5] Includes investments in European private equity, formerly Sagard Europe. [6] Valued at carrying value in accordance with IFRS. [7] In accordance with IAS 12 Income taxes, no deferred tax liability is recognized with respect to temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled corporations as the Corporation is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. If the Corporation were to dispose of an investment in a subsidiary or a jointly controlled corporation, income taxes payable on such disposition would be minimized through careful and prudent tax planning and structuring, as well as with the use of available tax attributes not otherwise recognized on the balance sheet, including tax losses, tax basis, safe income and foreign tax surplus associated with the subsidiary or jointly controlled corporation.\n\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures and Presentation\n\nIn the second quarter of 2020, the Corporation modified the presentation of the asset management companies held by the investment platforms. Previously, the asset management activities were consolidated and included as corporate activities within the non-consolidated balance sheet of the Corporation. Pursuant to the Corporation's recently announced strategy, the activities of each asset management company are now presented within their operations. The comparatives in the non-consolidated balance sheets and non-consolidated statement of cash flows have been restated to reflect this change.\n\nEffective the first quarter of 2020, the Corporation introduced a modified definition of its non-IFRS earnings measure, Adjusted net earnings. This change is consistent with the introduction of base earnings (loss) by Lifeco which was introduced in the first quarter of 2020 to reflect management's view of the operating performance of Lifeco. Lifeco defines base earnings (loss) as net earnings excluding the impact of actuarial assumption changes and management actions, direct equity and interest rate market impacts on insurance contract liabilities net of hedging, and items that management believes are not indicative of the company's underlying business results. The definition of Adjustments includes what the Corporation previously presented as other items and also includes Lifeco's impact of actuarial assumption changes and management actions, and direct equity and interest rate market impacts on insurance contract liabilities net of hedging. The definition of Adjustments used in Adjusted net earnings is being adopted to enhance comparability of results between reporting periods and in anticipation of Lifeco's implementation of accounting changes related to IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, on January 1, 2023. The comparative periods have been restated to reflect the introduction of this modified measure.\n\nNet earnings attributable to participating shareholders are comprised of:\n\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to participating shareholders; and\n\nAdjustments, which include the after-tax impact of any item that in management's judgment would make the period-over-period comparison of results from operations less meaningful. Adjustments include the Corporation's share of Lifeco's impact of actuarial assumption changes and management actions, direct equity and interest rate market impacts on insurance contract liabilities net of hedging, as well as items that management believes are not indicative of the underlying business results which include those identified by a subsidiary or a jointly controlled corporation.\n\nManagement uses these financial measures in its presentation and analysis of the financial performance of Power Corporation and believes that they provide additional meaningful information to readers in their analysis of the results of the Corporation. Adjusted net earnings, as defined by the Corporation, assist the reader in comparing the current period's results to those of previous periods as it reflects management's view of the operating performance of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and excludes items that are not considered to be part of the underlying business results from this non-IFRS financial measure.\n\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to participating shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non-IFRS financial measures that do not have a standard meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures used by other entities.\n\nThe Corporation also uses a non-consolidated basis of presentation to present and analyze its results whereby the Corporation's interests in Power Financial and other subsidiaries are accounted for using the equity method. Presentation on a non-consolidated basis is a non-IFRS presentation. However, it is useful to the reader as it presents the holding company's (parent) results separately from the results of its operating subsidiaries.\n\nNet asset value is commonly used by holding companies to determine their value. Net asset value is the fair value of Power Corporation's non-consolidated assets less its net debt and preferred shares. The investments held in public entities (including Lifeco, IGM and GBL (through Parjointco)) are measured at their market value and investments in private entities and investment funds are measured at management's estimate of fair value. Pargesa's net asset value is determined on the basis of current market values for listed shareholdings, plus the fair value of private equity activities and GBL treasury shares, less net debt. This measure presents the fair value of the net assets of the holding company to management and investors and assists the reader in determining the value of the holding company.\n\nThis news release may also contain other non-IFRS financial measures which are publicly disclosed by the Corporation's subsidiaries such as sales, assets under management and assets under administration. Refer to the \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures and Presentation\" section of the Corporation's most recent Management's Discussion and Analysis for the definition of non-IFRS financial measures and their reconciliation with IFRS financial measures.\n\nEligible Dividends\n\nFor purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and any similar provincial legislation, all of the above dividends on the Corporation's preferred shares (including the Participating Preferred Shares) and Subordinate Voting Shares are eligible dividends.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements in this news release, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements based on certain assumptions and reflect the Corporation's current expectations, or with respect to disclosure regarding the Corporation's public subsidiaries, reflect such subsidiaries' disclosed current expectations. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purposes of assisting the reader in understanding the Corporation's financial performance, financial position and cash flows as at and for the periods ended on certain dates and to present information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future and the reader is cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. These statements may include, without limitation, statements regarding the operations, business, financial condition, expected financial results, performance, prospects, opportunities, priorities, targets, goals, ongoing objectives, strategies and outlook of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including the fintech strategy, the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Corporation and its subsidiaries' operations, results and dividends, as well as the outlook for North American and international economies for the current fiscal year and subsequent periods, the intended effects of the Reorganization (as defined herein), and the proposed redemption by the Corporation and Power Financial of certain classes of their Second Preferred Shares. Forward-looking statements include statements that are predictive in nature, depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or include words such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"plans\", \"believes\", \"estimates\", \"seeks\", \"intends\", \"targets\", \"projects\", \"forecasts\" or negative versions thereof and other similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as \"may\", \"will\", \"should\", \"would\" and \"could\".\n\nBy its nature, this information is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may be general or specific and which give rise to the possibility that expectations, forecasts, predictions, projections or conclusions will not prove to be accurate, that assumptions may not be correct and that objectives, strategic goals and priorities will not be achieved. A variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Corporation's and its subsidiaries' control, affect the operations, performance and results of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and their businesses, and could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations of estimated or anticipated events or results.

This was followed by the east of England, which recorded a 53% increase, and the south-east where would-be buyer numbers were up by 52%.\n\nThe figures bear out reports from other estate agents that many buyers are favouring homes outside cities, with registrations for properties in the countryside up by 49%. Towns and suburbs recorded a 43% rise, while demand for city homes was up by 20%.\n\nThe data showed that this rise in appetite from buyers has increased competition at the offer stage, with 30% of sellers receiving bids from three or more buyers, compared with 25% this time last year.\n\nAs a result, agreed prices as a percentage of asking price have hit a record high. Figures for England and Wales showed properties were typically selling for 98.6% of their asking price. In Yorkshire and the Humber, sales are being agreed at just over 100% of asking price, while in the north-east of England the figure is 96.5%.\n\nAcross the month, 21% of homes in England and Wales sold above their initial asking price, Hamptons International said, up from 17% during the same period last year. Scotland\u2019s different property buying system meant it was excluded from the price-paid analysis.\n\nAneisha Beveridge, the head of research at Hamptons International, said the stamp duty holiday had boosted the market, but the impact of lockdown should also be considered as it could be driving demand for homes outside cities.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cThe number of people looking to buy a home has risen across every region in Great Britain since the announcement, with southern areas recording the biggest increase,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in these regions, where house prices tend to be higher, that buyers stand to gain the most from the holiday.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWith space topping buyers\u2019 wish lists, demand for homes in the suburbs and country locations has increased the most, and it\u2019s these homes that are most likely to sell above their asking price.\n\n\u201cOver the last decade house prices in cities have risen more than twice as much as those in the country, so this trend may mean the gap between city and country house prices will begin to close.\u201d"},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/auto\/cars\/hyundais-ioniq-plans-to-launch-three-evs-things-to-know\/articleshow\/77462334.cms","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 11:03:00","title":"How Hyundai plans to challenge Tesla with Ioniq","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.toiimg.com\/thumb\/msid-77462356,imgsize-749759,width-400,resizemode-4\/77462356.jpg","content":"Why Ioniq:\n\nWhat\u2019s the goal:\n\nProduct line-up:\n\nA special platform:\n\nTowering competition:\n\nSEOUL: Hyundai Motors is betting big on the Ioniq family of electric vehicles in an attempt to become the third-largest EV manufacturer by 2025.The Korean carmakers on Monday launched a dedicated EV brand under the name \u2018Ioniq\u2019, which will offer customer-centric EV experiences centered on connected lifestyle solutions.Under the brand, Hyundai will introduce three innovative IONIQ EV models over the next four years, starting early 2021 with Ioniq 5, a midsize EV CUV based on the concept \u201845\u2019.Ioniq EV models will be built on the E-GMP platform. Here are five things that we know about this new brand.Here\u2019s all you need to know about Hyundai\u2019s Ioniq brand:Hyundai first introduced the term Ioniq, which fuses \u201cion\u201d and \u201cunique\u201d, when it announced Project Ioniq, a long-term research and development project focused on eco-friendly mobility.Based on the project, Hyundai in 2016 introduced a vehicle named Ioniq, the world\u2019s first and only model to offer a choice of three electrified powertrain options \u2013 hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid and battery electric \u2013 within a single body type.Now, Ioniq represents Hyundai\u2019s growing commitment to sustainability and innovation and will be instrumental in achieving the company\u2019s clean mobility goals.Hyundai Motor Group recently announced that the group aims to sell 1 million units of battery electric vehicles and take 10 per cent share to become a leader in the global EV field by 2025.Under Strategy 2025, Hyundai Motor Company itself aims to become the world's third-largest automaker of eco-friendly vehicles by 2025, with 560,000 BEV(Battery Electric vehicles) sales in addition to FCEV (Fuel-Sale Electric Vehicles) sales.The launch of the Ioniq brand dedicated to EV models reinforces the company\u2019s commitment to clean mobility and reflects its ongoing transformation as a Smart Mobility Solution Provider with zero-emissions solutions.Hyundai will be launching a range of numerically named EVs under the new brand, with the even numbers used for sedans and the odd numbers for SUVs.The first model under the brand will be the Ioniq 5 midsize SUV that will launch in early-2021. Ioniq 5 is based on the concept EV \u201845\u2019, which Hyundai has already unveiled at the International Motor Show (IAA) 2019 in Frankfurt as a homage to its very first concept car.In 2022, Hyundai will introduce Ioniq 6 sedan, which is based on the company\u2019s latest concept EV \u2018Prophecy\u2019, unveiled in March; followed by Ioniq 7, a large SUV in early 2024.Each model will derive inspiration from past however, would be aimed at the future of mobility.Ioniq brand models will sit on an Electric Global Modular Platform, known as E-GMP, that will enable fast charging capability and plentiful driving range.To fulfill Ioniq\u2019s brand mission, Hyundai will combine its current EV capabilities \u2013 such as ultra-fast charging, spacious interior, and battery-supplied power \u2013 with future innovations that combine design, technologies and services to integrate in-car and out-of-car experiences for a seamless journey.Currently, the likes of Tesla, VW Group and Nissan-Renault alliance lead the pack of BEV manufacturers.California-based Tesla which makes only electric vehicles, aims to retain its current position as the world's EV leader. Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he expects the company to sell \"a few million\" vehicles in 2025."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/coronavirus-90m-insurance-payout-for-covid-19-death-claims-at-pandemics-peak-12048033","domain":"news.sky.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 02:09:24","title":"Coronavirus: \u00a390m insurance payout for COVID-19 death claims at pandemic's peak","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/e3.365dm.com\/20\/08\/768x432\/skynews-funeral-coronavirus_5065953.jpg?20200812204925","content":"Insurance firms are set to have paid out \u00a390m in coronavirus death claims to grieving families at the height of the pandemic, the industry has revealed.\n\nThis equates to \u00a3980,000 a day when the UK was in the grip of the COVID-19 crisis, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI).\n\nThe data was published as the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) reduced the number of coronavirus deaths by more than 5,000 to 41,329 following a review of how figures are calculated.\n\nThe ABI said 7,000 life insurance claims were received between 1 March and 31 May this year and \u00a390m paid or due to be paid to the relatives of those who died as a result of the coronavirus.\n\nThe majority of those, some 6,689 claims, were made under individual protection policies, with the rest under group schemes.\n\nMost of the claims - 83% - have been paid to date, with every one submitted so far accepted.\n\nThe average payout on term insurance is expected to be \u00a363,000, with \u00a3137,000 on group policies.\n\nTerm life insurance provides a payout to families when people die within a time period set out by the policy.\n\nGroup life insurance covers a group of people, such as employees within a company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker\n\nRoshani Hill, the ABI's head of protection and health, said: \"Every COVID-19 death is a tragedy.\n\n\"While no amount of money can ever replace a life, insurers have been doing all that they can to help families cope financially through these unprecedented and distressing times.\n\n\"We know that coronavirus has long lasting impacts, and protection insurers will continue to support families hit by this tragedy.\n\n\"No one knows what is round the corner, which is why protecting yourself and your family against the worst is vitally important.\"\n\nThe UK insurance and long-term savings industry is also supporting charities that are helping people hardest hit by the crisis.\n\nLaunched in May, the COVID-19 support fund has helped to generate \u00a383.9m of pledges in voluntary contributions from firms."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.timescolonist.com\/news\/local\/7-eleven-store-in-victoria-closed-after-employee-tests-positive-for-covid-19-1.24187099","domain":"timescolonist.com","published_date":"2020-08-15 16:33:00","title":"7-Eleven store in Victoria closed after employee tests positive for COVID-19","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.vmcdn.ca\/f\/files\/glaciermedia\/import\/lmp-all\/1608565-TC-7026-web-7-eleven.jpg;w=960","content":"7-Eleven Canada has closed one of its Douglas Street locations in Victoria after an employee tested positive for COVID-19.

This week, Uber and Lyft\u2019s legal battle against a California law pertaining to independent contractors continued. As of right now, it\u2019s looking like Uber and Lyft are going to temporarily cease operations in California next week if they can\u2019t get their way.\n\nMeanwhile, Pinterest employees reached their breaking point when former COO Fran\u00e7oise Brougher sued Pinterest alleging gender discrimination and wrongful termination. Now, they\u2019re demanding systemic change at the company in light of the latest allegation of discrimination.\n\nGig Life\n\nUber and Lyft say they\u2019ll have to temporarily pause operations in California\n\nA lot happened with Uber and Lyft this week, so let\u2019s break down exactly what transpired. But first, a quick recap of the events leading up to Uber threatening to cease operations in California.\n\nJanuary 1, 2020: Assembly Bill 5 becomes law. The bill, first introduced in December 2018, codified the ruling established in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles. In that case, the court applied the ABC test and decided Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors. According to the ABC test, in order for a hiring entity to legally classify a worker as an independent contractor, it must prove (A) the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity, (B) performs work outside the scope of the entity\u2019s business and (C) is regularly engaged in an \u201cindependently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.\u201d\n\nMay 2020: California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, along with city attorneys from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco, filed a lawsuit asserting Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by misclassifying workers as independent contractors.\n\nThe suit argues Uber and Lyft are depriving workers the right to minimum wage, overtime, access to paid sick leave, disability insurance and unemployment insurance. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of San Francisco, seeks $2,500 in penalties for each violation, possibly per driver, under the California Unfair Competition Law, and another $2,500 for violations against senior citizens or people with disabilities.\n\nJune 2020: Becerra and others file a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to force Uber and Lyft to immediately classify their drivers as employees.\n\nAugust 6, 2020: California Superior Court Judge Ethan P. Schulman hears arguments pertaining to the preliminary injunction. At the hearing, Uber and Lyft maintained that an injunction would require them to restructure their businesses in such a material way that it would prevent them from being able to employ many drivers on either a full-time or part-time basis. Uber and Lyft\u2019s argument, effectively, is that classifying drivers as employees would result in job loss.\n\n\u201cThe proposed injunction would cause irreparable injury to Lyft and Uber, and would actually cause massive harm to drivers and harm to riders,\u201d Rohit Singla, counsel for Lyft, said at the hearing.\n\nFor example, Lyft estimates it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars simply to process the I-9 forms, which verify employment eligibility. It doesn\u2019t cost anything to file that form, but it would require Uber and Lyft to further invest in their human resources and payroll processes.\n\nAugust 9, 2020: Judge Schulman grants the preliminary injunction, which goes into effect on August 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cThe Court is under no illusion that implementation of its injunction will be costly,\u201d Judge Schulman wrote in the order. \u201cThere can be no question that in order for Defendants to comply with A.B. 5, they will have to change the nature of their business practices in significant ways, such as by hiring human resources staff to hire and manage their driver workforces.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Uber and Lyft made clear their respective plans to file emergency appeals.\n\nAugust 12, 2020: Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says Uber will have to temporarily shut down in California if the court doesn\u2019t overturn the preliminary injunction. Lyft says it, too, will be forced to temporarily cease operations in California.\n\nAugust 13, 2020: Judge Schulman denies Uber and Lyft\u2019s appeal. Uber says it plans to file another appeal, while Lyft says it will seek a further stay from the state\u2019s appellate court.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nAugust 20, 2020: Preliminary injunction is set to go into effect and Uber and Lyft will likely be temporarily ceasing operations in California.\n\nNovember 2020: Californians will vote on Prop 22, a ballot measure majorly funded by Uber, Lyft and DoorDash. Prop 22 aims to keep gig workers classified as independent contractors. The measure, if passed, would make drivers and delivery workers for said companies exempt from a new state law that classifies them as W-2 employees.\n\nThe ballot measure looks to implement an earnings guarantee of at least 120% of minimum wage while on the job, 30 cents per mile for expenses, a healthcare stipend, occupational accident insurance for on-the-job injuries, protection against discrimination and sexual harassment and automobile accident and liability insurance.\n\nStay Woke\n\nPinterest\u2019s fall from grace\n\nBack in 2015, Pinterest was known as one of the companies doing some of the best work around diversity, equity and inclusion. That perception changed this year.\n\nPinterest was one of the first tech companies to set concrete hiring goals. In 2015, those goals were to increase hiring rates for full-time engineering roles to 30% female; increase hiring rates for full-time engineers to 8% from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds; increase hiring rates for non-engineering roles to 12% underrepresented backgrounds; and implement a Rooney Rule requirement where at least one person from an underrepresented background and one female candidate is interviewed for every open leadership position.\n\nPinterest was also one of the first companies to hire a head of diversity and inclusion. In 2016, Pinterest hired Candice Morgan for the role. Morgan left the company earlier this year and joined VC firm GV as its equity, diversity and inclusion partner. Still, Morgan had one of the longest stints at any tech company\u2019s diversity and inclusion department.\n\nIn the company\u2019s 2020 diversity report, Pinterest showed it beat all of its hiring goals, but what was missing from that report was retention data. When TechCrunch asked in January if they would make the data available, a Pinterest spokesperson said, \u201cunfortunately, we can\u2019t share the retention metrics publicly, but it will continue to be an internal priority.\u201d\n\nNow, transparency about retention data is just one of a handful of demands Pinterest employees have. Two days ago, former Pinterest COO Fran\u00e7oise Brougher sued the company, alleging gender discrimination, retaliation and wrongful termination. Prior to that, Aerica Shimizu Banks and Ifeoma Ozoma, also accused Pinterest of discrimination.\n\nIn light of those allegations, Pinterest employees are walking out today to demand change at the company. The walkout is directly in response to recent accusations of racial and gender discrimination at Pinterest. In addition to the walkout, there\u2019s a petition circulating throughout the company demanding systemic change.

The telecom major, which reported a Rs 25,460 crore loss for June quarter, is looking to restructure and raise money.But it is losing subscribers fast and has the Supreme Court verdict on AGR looming over its head. Analysts said the company needs to increase average revenue per user ( Arpu ) to Rs 150-175 in order to be able to stay in business.The telco says the industry can easily absorb tariff hikes, but analysts have doubts. The telecom firm reported a drop in Arpu during a lockdown-hit quarter when peers saw a sharp rise. Its low investments in the 4G space could also pose a problem to increasing Arpu, said analysts, who have advised retail investors to steer clear of the stock.The telco needs to pay around Rs 50,400 crore more to the Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) in license fee, spectrum usage charges ( SUC ), interest and penalties. The top court will hear its appeal today for a staggered payment option.The head of research with a top domestic brokerage, which has suspended rating of Vodafone Idea, said the AGR issue is the biggest hangover for the stock.\u201cVodafone fares poorly compared with peers. They have lost 2.2 crore customers in June quarter, which is almost 7 per cent of its total subscriber base. Arpu at Rs 114 was much lower than Reliance Jio's Rs 130.60, and Bharti Airtel\u2019s Rs 157.\"Vodafone Idea is looking to focus on top circles, this analyst said, noting that Vodafone was focusing on Tier 1 cities, while Idea was Tier III and IV player before the merger. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag now,\" he said.The company is facing competition from Bharti at the top end and Jio at the bottom end,\u201d he said.On Friday, the company\u2019s MD Ravinder Takkar said telecom Arpus are \"still far from being sustainable\" and the market has the ability to absorb further tariff hikes, which will fix structural issues faced by the sector and enable telcos to generate reasonable returns.Takkar said he does not agree with the view that 2G services need to be stopped, since it is a low-cost service still preferred by certain set of users.Umesh Mehta of Samco Securities said since the company reported a drop in Arpu during the lockdown period, when peers saw a sharp jump, there is something structurally wrong.\u201cDemand for telecom services was expected to rise during the lockdown period with India Inc opting for work from home strategy, which pushed up demand for data,\u201d he said.\u201cThere is no certainty that the company will survive even though it is backed by a big corporate house. Eventually, the customer is the king. If the customers themselves are leaving and dissatisfied, this in itself is a warning bell. From an investment point of view, investors should stay clear of this stock.It has no equity value left given the huge debt and future liabilities, Mehta said.Data showed the subscriber base for the telecom major fell to 27.98 crore at the end of June from 29.1 million at the March-end. Its 4G user base fell to 10.46 crore from 10.56 crore. This dragged ARPU down to Rs 114 from Rs 121 in the previous quarter.After making huge provision for statutory dues, Vodafone Idea\u2019s net worth has turned to negative at Rs 19,500 crore at June end. Exceptional costs in Q1 included Rs 19,440 crore relating to total estimated AGR dues, Rs 123 crore as one-time spectrum charge and Rs 3.70 crore in merger-related costs. CLSA in a report said Vodafone Idea\u2019s AGR burden is \u2018enormous\u2019.\u201cEven if a 20-year tenure is granted, Voda Idea \u2019s EMI on the telecom department\u2019s estimates will be 30 per cent of cash Ebitda, when debt burden is also rising at Rs 1.15 lakh crore. Some 80 per cent of this amount is for spectrum liabilities, which have a two-year moratorium,\u201d CLSA said. \u201cOur key concern is undercutting capex to conserve cash.\"While the sequential capex decline is understandable given the Covid impact, the extent is surprising and we see structural risks,\u201d Bank of America (BofA) Securities said in a note.An ET report suggested that the loss-making operator has started a restructuring drive to help save Rs 4,000 crore on an annualised basis over next 18 months.The steps included cutting IT costs, centralising decision making, lowering distribution costs by pushing digital recharges and automating functions. The report suggests the telco is looking to monetise its 11.15 per cent stake in Indus Towers after its merger with Bharti Infratel and sell its optic fibre and data centres to raise funds.Separately, Google is reported to have been in talks to buy a stake in the telco. The stock has rallied over 100 per cent in last three months.\"The gains in the telecom market seem to be asymmetrical. On one hand, we have seen Bharti gain in terms of Arpu and on the other hand, we are seeing Vodafone-Idea lose out. Some of the higher value users are quitting Vodafone-Idea because of their financial issues and porting out to Airtel mostly or to Jio,\u201d Sandip Sabharwal of asksandipsabharwal told ET NOW."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/earnings\/call-transcripts\/2020\/08\/06\/himax-technologies-inc-himx-q2-2020-earnings-call.aspx","domain":"fool.com","published_date":"2020-08-06 20:30:58","title":"Himax Technologies, Inc.

Eric, the floor is yours.\n\nEric Tzung-I Li -- Chief of IR\/PR Officer\n\nThank you, Mark, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. My name is Eric Li, and I am the new Chief IR\/PR Officer. Joining me are Jordan Wu, our CEO; and Jessica Pan, our newly appointed CFO. On today's call, we will first review the Himax consolidated financial performance for the second quarter, followed by the third quarter 2020 outlook. Jordan will then give an update on the status of our business, after which we will take questions. We will review our financials on both IFRS and non-IFRS basis. The non-IFRS financial exclude share-based compensation and acquisition-related charges. We pre-announced the preliminary key financial results for the second quarter on July 6, 2020 with revenue, gross margin and EPS, all exceeding the guidance issued on May 7, 2020.\n\nToday, our reported results for the revenue, gross margin and EPS were all in line with the preannounced results. For the second quarter, we recorded net revenues of $187.0 million, an increase of 1.3% sequentially and an increase of 10.4% compared to the same period last year. The 1.3% sequential increase of revenues exceeded our guidance of a slight decrease with 5% and quarter-over-quarter high demand of large display driver for monitor and greater-than-expected shipment volume for both smartphone and tablet contributed to the better-than-guided sales. Gross margin was 21%, exceeding the prior guidance between 20.2% to 20.6% due to a more favorable product mix among large display products. IFRS profit per diluted ADS was $0.008, exceeding our guidance of a loss of $0.015 to $0.005. Strong sales, improved gross margin and lower-than-expected operating trends contributed to the better-than-expected earnings result.\n\nNon-IFRS profit per diluted ADS was $0.01, exceeding our guidance of a loss of $0.013 to $0.003. Revenue from large display drivers was $59.5 million, down 3.1% sequentially and up 0.2% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven by lower shipments into TVs due to weakness in the global TV market, which are severely impacted by COVID-19 outbreak. TV segment revenue decreased 21.7% year-over-year, offsetting the weakness in the TV segment was a surge in the demand of telework and online education tools that spurred the sales in our monitor and the notebook segments to an increase of around 60% year-over-year in Q2. Large panel driver ICs accounted for 31.8% of total revenue for the quarter compared to 33.2% in the first quarter of 2020 and 35% a year ago. Revenue for small- and medium-sized display driver was $98.8 million, up 12.9% sequentially and 20.9% year-over-year. The sequential growth was driven primarily by tablet and smartphone sales, but offset by a decrease in the automobile segment. The strong year-over-year growth was attributable to remarkable tablet sales, especially our TDDI product for tablet. The segment accounted for 52.8% of total sales for the quarter compared to 47.4% in the first quarter of 2020 and 48.3% a year ago.\n\nSales into smartphones were up 10.9% sequentially, but down 26.8% year-over-year. Our smartphone TDDI was up 69% sequentially and up 0.3% from the same period last year. Strength in the smartphone TDDI segment reflected customers' aggressive new product launch plans with our TDDI solutions. We reported earlier that the launch of several customers' new smartphone with our TDDI solution inside were delayed because of the pandemic. Many of those projects started mass production in Q2, leading to the strong sequential growth. Sales of traditional DDICs for smartphones declined by 43.6% sequentially and were down 58.3% from the same period last year. Our traditional DDIC, which represents just 26.3% of the smartphone segment in Q2, declined significantly, a trend that was expected that we have repeatedly reported that the traditional DDIC was quickly being replaced by TDDI and AMOLED for smartphone application. We expect to see a short-term spike of traditional DDIC demand for smartphone during the third quarter, arising from orders from certain brand customers. However, again, barring short-term fluctuations, we expect to see continuous decline in the traditional DDIC for smartphone. The ongoing COVID-19 dynamic has eroded worldwide smartphone market demand with a more than [10%] expected decline during 2020, according to several research institutes. Despite these challenging conditions, we expect to see smartphone TDDI sales in second half of 2020 due to a more diversified customer base, strong product road map and a enriched product portfolio.\n\nAs anticipated, boosted by the strong momentum in both traditional discrete driver IC and the TDDI product lines, tablet was the best performing product category of all in Q2, up 55.1% sequentially and 174.8% year-over-year. It represented around 23% of our total sales in Q2. We expect this product segment to continue to grow in the second half as the overall market for tablet looks to remain robust, thanks to work from home and online education demands. In addition, there is new demand for tablet TDDI, of which the sales was up 83.2% sequentially in Q2, as in-cell touch display is quickly becoming a new mainstream for Android tablet. Jordan will elaborate on the outlook of tablet TDDI in a few minutes. Booted by demand for remote work and education, the revenue of traditional discrete driver IC for tablet delivered more than 40% sequential growth and more than 70% year-over-year in the second quarter. Specifically, we shipped more of the higher ASP ICs with higher resolution and the COF packaging for large-sized SLiM bezel tablet to certain leading brand names.\n\nAs expected, our driver IC revenue for the automotive application was down 15.2% sequentially as a result of global production and car sales coming to a certain hold in most of the world. However, on a year-over-year basis, automotive driver IC revenue was up 0.1% despite the effect of the pandemic. Second quarter revenue from our non-driver business was $28.7 million, down 19.5% sequentially, but up 1.7% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was mainly due to significant shipment reduction of WLO product to an anchor customer and lower engineering fee income for other non-driver products. Offsetting the weakness in WLO, CMOS image sensors had higher revenue contribution from notebook and IP camera application for remote work and online education purposes. Non-driver products accounted for 15.4% of total revenue as compared to 19.4% in the first quarter of 2020 and 16.7% a year ago. Gross margin for the second quarter was 21%, down 170 basis points sequentially, but up 150 basis points from the same period last year. The sequential decrease was caused by lower WLO shipment and weak automotive sales, two of our higher gross margin products. A decline in the engineering fees received was also a factor behind the sequential decline. Year-over-year basis, it was up 1.5%, mainly due to a more favorable product mix with more shipments of WLO and Tcon products.\n\nOur IFRS operating expenses were $37.6 million in the second quarter, up 0.9% from the preceding quarter, but down 3.3% from a year ago. The year-over-year decrease was a result of the decreased salary and traveling expenses. Non-IFRS operating expenses for the second quarter were $37.2 million, up 1.4% from the previous quarter, but down 3.2% from the same quarter in 2019. IFRS operating margin for the second quarter was 0.9%, down from 2.5% in the prior quarter, but up from minus 3.5% in the same period last year. The sequential decrease was mainly due to lower gross margin.\n\nThe year-over-year improvement was primarily a result of higher sales, better gross margin and the lower operating expenses. Second quarter non-IFRS operating profit was $2.1 million or 1.1% of sales, lower from non-IFRS operating profit of $5.3 million or 2.9% of sales last quarter, but up from minus 3.2% for the same period last year. IFRS profit for the second quarter was $1.4 million or $0.008 per diluted ADS compared to the profit of $3.3 million or $0.019 per diluted ADS in the previous quarter and a loss of $5.2 million or $0.03 per diluted ADS a year ago. Second quarter non-IFRS profit was $1.7 million or $0.01 per diluted ADS compared to non-IFRS profit of $3.8 million or $0.022 per diluted ADS last quarter and non-IFRS loss of $4.8 million or $0.028 per diluted ADS for the same period last year. Turning to the balance sheet. We had $107.1 million of cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets as of the end of June 2020 to $122.4 million at the same time last year and $126.6 million a quarter ago.\n\nThe lower cash balance as of the end of the second quarter was mainly a result of a repayment of unsecured borrowing of $9.4 million and an operating cash outflow of $9.2 million during the quarter. On top of the cash position, restricted cash was $164.0 million at the end of the quarter, the same as preceding quarter and a year ago. The restricted cash is mainly used to guarantee the secured short-term borrowing for the same amount. We had $58.4 million of unsecured short-term loan as of the end of Q2 compared to $67.9 million a quarter ago and $77.0 million at the same time last year.\n\nAccount receivable at the end of June 2020 were $206.1 million, up from $186.7 million last quarter and $176.2 a year ago. DSO was 101 days at the end of the quarter as compared to 96 days a year ago and 92 days at the end of last quarter. Inventory as at June 30, 2020 were $161.5 million, up from $148.4 million last quarter, but down from $188.5 million a year ago. In response to an industrywide capacity shortage and in preparation for a strong Q3 forecast, we had to increase inventory levels during Q2. We believe our inventory position is healthy given solid forecast and the purchase orders received from customers. While we monitor our inventory carefully by working closely with our customers, we will continue to build up our inventory position aggressively in the foreseeable future given the prevailing severe foundry capacity shortage in the marketplace. We expect the inventory level to be significantly low over the course of Q3, again, because of very tight foundry capacity and the strong customer demand.\n\nNet cash outflow from operating activities for the second quarter was $9.2 million as compared to an outflow of $17.7 million of the same period last year and an inflow of $10.6 million last quarter. Net cash outflow was mainly caused by more aggressive inventory buildup. Second quarter capital expenditure amounted to $0.7 million versus $5.7 million a year ago and $3.1 million last quarter. As reported, in the last earnings call, the capex for both new building construction and the 3D sensing capacity expansion were already concluded in the fourth quarter 2019. The second quarter capex was for R&D-related equipment for our IC design business.\n\nBefore concluding my report of the second quarter results, I would like to provide an update on dividend. We typically make annual cash dividend payment at the middle of the year based on prior year's profitability. Our Board of Directors has decided that we will not pay cash dividend in 2020. The decision was made with full consideration of Himax's 2019 financial results as well as 2020 operation and capital requirements. As of June 30, 2020, Himax has 172.3 million ADS outstanding, little change from last quarter. On a fully diluted basis, the total number of ADS outstanding was 130 173.2 million. Q3 2020 guidance. At this point, we expect to deliver strong growth for the third quarter. We see very good momentum in our smartphone TDDI business against the backdrop of a depressed global smartphone market. Our tablet ICs, both discrete driver and TDDI, made a remarkable contribution to our first half results and are on track to carry a nice momentum into second half. We also foresee decent growth for the notebook, TV and the Tcon for products the next quarter. However, third quarter growth will be constrained due to an industrywide foundry shortage. Similar to our usual practice before 2019, we grant RSUs, rather than stock options on September 30 this year for employees' share-based; compensation. As a reminder, we did not grant RSUs last year. Rather 2,226,690 units of stock option were granted to the team at an exercise price of $2.27 last September. Our third quarter IFRS earnings per diluted ADS guidance has taken into account the expected 2020 RSU grant, which, subject to Board approval, is now assumed to be around $3.0 million or $0.013 per diluted ADS, almost all of which will be vested and expensed immediately on September 30, the grant date.\n\nThe grant of RSUs would lead to higher third quarter IFRS operating expenses compared to other quarters of the year. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to increase by around 20% sequentially. Gross margin is expected to be flat to slightly down from second quarter, depending on our annual product mix. IFRS profit attributable to shareholders is expected to be in the range of around $0.02 to $0.028 per fully diluted ADS. Non-IFRS profit attributable to shareholders is expected to be in the range of $0.035 to $0.043 per fully diluted ADS.\n\nI will now turn the call over to Jordan. Jordan, the floor is yours.\n\nJordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nThank you, Eric. While the COVID-19 does not look to be going away anytime soon, most countries have greatly eased lockdowns while still taking measures to contain the spread of the virus. Although the pandemic has brought major disruptions to the market we operate in, many of our panel customers have been fast to react to the changing environment by quickly shifting their production to where the demands are. What that reflected in our business is a very strong sales for notebook and monitor markets in the first half with the momentum now switching to TV and smartphone, while tablet is set to stay robust throughout the whole year. While businesses have been largely reopened, a big part of the society still stays mostly at home with much of the activity being operated online. The stay-at-home economy has proven to benefit several consumer electronics markets to which we supply our products. Our demand visibility has, therefore, been much improved from the first half. However, as Eric mentioned earlier, the industry is going through a severe foundry capacity shortage right now, which is limiting the growth in almost all of our businesses, especially the smartphone and tablet TDDI as well as CMOS image sensor products.\n\nSeparately, we are working toward capitalizing on our unique non-driver technologies where we have invested heavily in the past few years, notably, 3D sensing for smartphone and smart door lock as well as ultralow power smart image sensing for products such as notebook, TV, doorbell and air conditioner. I will elaborate on this a bit later. As indicated in our guidance, we now expect a strong top line growth for Q3. Our next goal is to improve our gross margin. This will be an important target for Q4 and next year.\n\nNow let me take you through each of our major business areas. Let's start with the large-panel driver IC business update. For the third quarter, we expect the large display driver IC revenue to decrease by high single-digit sequentially, mainly due to weak demand for monitor ICs where our customers are going through an inventory adjustment after two quarters of strong shipments. However, TV and notebook ICs are picking up momentum in Q3. The TV market, our biggest large display sector, is experiencing a solid rebound lately with panel prices rising and set makers rushing in for inventory replenishment after quite a few sluggish quarters. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver low teens growth for TV display driver, both sequentially and year-over-year. For the monitor segment, following a demand surge in the previous two quarters, we expect customers' inventory to correct, resulting in a sequential decrease in Q3\n\nIn the notebook segment, as we mentioned earlier, we see continuous demand fueled particularly by enterprise and e-learning as we approach the back-to-school season. Our businesses in the high-end monitor and new generation low power notebook products, where we are the market leader in DDICs and Tcon, will benefit significantly from this trend. Now let's turn to the small- and medium-sized display driver business, beginning with an update on our smartphone segment. Our TDDI product roadmap as well as new design wins with end customers position Himax well to gain market share throughout 2020. The pandemic has negatively weighed on both smartphone production and consumer demand. While 2020 remains a challenging year for the smartphone market, China is already gradually recovering and other countries are moving in the same direction. On the current pipeline, we expect to more than double our smartphone TDDI shipments during Q3 compared to the previous quarter. The smartphone market continues to embrace new technologies, moving toward higher frame rate displays to enable better screen viewing and gaming experience. Our high frame rate products have been adopted by several top-tier customers and have begun mass production in Q2.\n\nAs discussed previously, a major development we are seeing in the marketplace is the increasing utilization of the OLED display for smartphones. This is due to expanded AMOLED capacity as well as increased demand for under-display fingerprint technology, that is only available in the AMOLED display currently. We are encouraged by the progress we have made and are collaborating closely with leading panel makers across China for AMOLED product development. Additionally, we have made good progress in wear order AMOLED display driver ICs with leading Chinese panel makers. We believe AMOLED driver ICs will soon become one of the major growth engines for our small panel driver IC business. Turning to the tablet business. We expect our tablet ICs to be a major growth area throughout 2020 with a strong forecast for both discrete driver ICs and TDDI in the third quarter. Tablet demand is picking up strongly in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, that is fueling remote work and learning. As mentioned in previous earnings calls, Himax pioneered the TDDI solution for tablet and is the dominant supplier for literally all leading Android brand names.\n\nTablet TDDI, just two quarters in mass production, already accounted for around 37% of our tablet IC sales. And if you look at as a separate product category, represented almost 9% of our total revenues in Q2. We expect an increase of more than 20% sequentially for our tablet TDDI next quarter with the momentum to continue into Q4. Tablet in-cell TDDI offers the benefit of lower cost and a simplified supply chain and represents an easier manufacturing process for panel makers. For consumers, it offers a lighter weight, slimmer and more stylish design as well as improved touch accuracy with added option for active stylus. Similar to smartphone, demand for traditional display driver IC for tablet is also being eroded by in-cell TDDI, but at a more moderate pace. For the tablet segment, we expect to deliver another sequential growth of low teens with shipments to almost quadruple that of the same time last year. Again, this is thanks to the sudden surge of tablet demand arising from the pandemic and the new TDDI revenue that did not exist last year.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that while the tablet market is smaller than smartphone, the ASP and number of units for TDDI in each tablet are both higher than those for smartphone. Turning to the automotive sector. The global automotive sector has badly hit by the COVID-19, and the market outlook remains uncertain during the second half of 2020. Himax commands more than 30% of the global automotive DDIC market and inevitably, this business is impacted by the slow overall demand. However, while the sequential revenue was down 15.2% in Q2, revenue for the first half was still up 3.3% year-over-year. Our technology leadership in automotive display market has helped us continue to gain ground with customers. We expect to deliver a mid-single-digit sequential increase in the third quarter, and we will remain the leader in this market as the major developing trends have not changed amid short-term challenges.\n\nBacked by our leading market position in new technologies for automotive display, we have a strong and positive long-term outlook for the automotive segment. We are the primary partner for most of the world's of automotive panel makers to enable new technologies. Specifically, Himax has been selected by many leading Tier one and OEMs for the upcoming first launches of vehicles using displays with TDDI technology. While we only expect a small volume of shipments in 2020, we anticipate meaningful full production shipments of automotive TDDI as we move into 2021. For the third quarter, revenue for the small- and medium-sized driver IC is expected to increase by over 40% sequentially.\n\nNow let me share some of the progress we made on the non-driver IC businesses in the last quarter. First, on the WLO business. The second quarter WLO revenue declined sequentially due to lower shipment to an anchor customer. The factory to which we usually ship this product was ordered to shut down temporarily by the local government as part of their disease containment measures. However, our shipments to the anchor customer recorded a nice growth compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to engage several strategic customers and all partners to develop new projects for DOE, diffuser and optical lens solutions for future generation products, covering a wide range of different applications.\n\nNext is an update on the 3D sensing business. In smartphone applications, most customer inquiries and design projects are moving toward ToF 3D sensing for world-facing camera that features longer range and wider angle coverage for AR, 3D modeling and gaming features. With ToF, we provide optical components and\/or projectors, which are critical in the performance of the whole ToF solution. In this business, we have partnerships with ToF sensor providers, laser vendors and smartphone makers and are engaged for various stages of product development for next-generation smartphones. For non-smartphone 3D sensing engagements, we focus on smart door lock and payment system applications where we provide structured light-based 3D sensing total solutions. To broaden our market reach, we also offer our market-leading 3D decoder ASIC as an individual component for integration into other systems. Through such partnerships, we are able to reach out to markets that we are not yet familiar with, such as industrial robotics and access control systems. 3D sensing remains one of the main growth drivers for us. Now switching gears to the WiseEye smart sensing solution. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, in order for our WiseEye technology to reach its maximum potential, we have adopted a flexible business model whereby, in addition to a total solution where we provide processor, image sensor and AI algorithm.\n\nWe also offer those individually as key parts in order to address the market's different needs and widen our market coverage. For customers who own their own algorithm and wish to develop their own applications, we can provide our ultralow power AI processor and image sensor without algorithm. The customers can piggyback on our technology and focus their efforts on bringing AI to edge devices by transforming a wide range of sensor data, including video, sound, movement, gesture, among others, into actionable information, all with extremely low power consumption. For those consumers\/partners whose main business is to provide AI processors, we can offer our ultralow power image sensors without our AI processor and algorithm.\n\nFor the total solution offering, we launched a computer vision human detection NB solution, which has been well recognized and is being incorporated into the next-generation premium notebook models of key OEMs and ODMs. Our total solutions are also being integrated into a wide range of other applications such as TV, doorbell, door lock, air conditioner, etc, by engaging leading players in those industries. For the other types of business model where we only offer key parts, our strategy is to actively participate in ecosystems led by the world's leading AI and cloud service providers. A recent illustration of this strategy is an announcement for the collaboration with Google, whereby, running or Google's TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers kernel. We provided our AI processor with CNN for convolutional neural network-based SDK, or software development kit, for developers to generate deep learning influences with video and voice command data to boost overall system performance while consuming extremely low power. Being an official partner of Google's TensorFlow, we get to enjoy the enormous network of its ecosystem participants.\n\nNow over a month after the announcement, we are already receiving inquiries from large corporations and individual AI developers alike with application ideas covering a broad range of industries. We are very encouraged by the enthusiastic discussions about possible WiseEye applications that are taking place in various user groups for emerging AI market ideas. Last but not least, we are working closely with other leading AI and cloud service providers worldwide to incorporate WiseEye edge AI solution into their ecosystems, in an attempt to reach the broadest market coverage possible. We are extremely excited about these developments.\n\nNow turning to our CMOS image sensor business update. Due to the accelerated adoption of work from home and online education, demand for CMOS image sensor for notebook and IP camera will remain strong during the third quarter. Our industry-first 2-in-1 CMOS image sensor has penetrated into the laptop ecosystem for the most stylish super slim bezel design with three types of popular application features, namely RGB sensor for video conference, RGB\/IR sensor for Windows Hello facial recognition and\/or ultralow power AI computer vision for human presence detection. We expect to see small volume in certain premium notebook models in late 2020 with small volume expected in the coming years.\n\nFor the traditional human vision segment, we also see strong demand in multimedia applications such as car recorders, surveillance, drones, home appliances and consumer electronics, among others. Lastly, on LCOS. We continue to focus on AR goggle devices and head-up-display for automotive. Many of our industry-leading customers have demonstrated their state-of-the-art products, including holographic HUD, AR glasses and LiDAR systems with Himax LCOS technology inside. Our technology leadership and proven manufacturing expertise have made us a preferred partner for customers in these emerging markets and their ongoing engineering projects in AR goggles and HUD for automotive applications. For non-driver IC business, we expect revenue to increase by low teens sequentially in the third quarter.\n\nThat concludes my report for this quarter. Thank you for your interest in Himax. We appreciate you joining today's call and we are now ready to take questions.\n\nQuestions and Answers:\n\nOperator\n\n[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird.\n\nTristan Gerra -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\n\nWould you be able to quantify the revenue impact of the foundry shortages on your Q3 guidance?\n\nJordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nFoundry shortage. It's almost across the board actually covering large and small CMOS image sensor. What happens is for mature technologies, very severely for 8-inch, but even for 12-inch. With the 5G smartphone and other things coming up, foundry capacity, we believe, will be a long-term phenomena. Foundry capacity shortage will be a long-term phenomenon. So we are we made the right decision to develop a new and major foundry partner being PSMC back in 2008 2018, for 3D [Indecipherable] and that was the [Indecipherable] we met at the time. Because without that, we wouldn't have been able to see the growth. But I think foundry capacity shortage, unfortunately and fortunately, in fact, is here to stay and is not going away anytime soon we believe. I don't know if there are any more specifics you want to know about.\n\nTristan Gerra -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\n\nOkay. No, that helps. I was just wondering maybe what percentage higher your revenue guidance will be, if you were able to access all the capacity that you need?\n\nJordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nMuch higher. Much, much higher. Yes, and also good news of [Indecipherable] for the fact it's going to be much higher, especially for smartphone and tablet TDDI. So let me just probably take this opportunity to elaborate just a little bit. Again, the more specially impacted areas of smartphone and the tablet TDDI. For both, we use the same pool of [Indecipherable] foundry. Q3, the shortage is severe and Q4, also very, very bad. Now with the limited capacity available to us, we have to make a very difficult allocation choice. So what happens and so one of our guiding principle for such allocation choice is we will give preferred allocation to where we are the main source or even the sole source. And if you follow this guidance, then inevitably, our allocation will favor tablet more than smartphone because with tablet, we have a very large market share. And we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are the sole or dominant or major vendor to literally all the [9-inch] joint tablet demand. So if you look at Q3, we expect to see a very strong growth for small- and medium-sized market together, but the tablet growth is higher than smartphone. And if you look at Q4, where our allocation will be skewed more even more toward tablet because the shortage is just pretty severe. So Q4, in all likelihood, will see very, very strong tab let growth, again, for TDDI, but probably some decline in smartphone because of our allocation choices. Overall, however, our allocated total foundry capacity for TDDI 12-inch for Q4 will be higher than for Q3, but certainly not enough for us to pick up all the orders. I hope that adding comment is helpful.\n\nTristan Gerra -- Robert W. Baird & Co. -- Analyst\n\nYes, definitely, very useful. And then just the last question on the same topic is do you feel that your competition is facing the same issues and as such you don't expect market share shift because of you being impacted more from a capacity access standpoint than your competitors?\n\nJordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nYes, we believe so. And based on my customers and some of the key vendors who get to see many of my competitors' production or working process status. We are probably one of the players whose position is better off compared to some of our peers. So yes, I think it's an industrywide phenomenon, it is everybody, pretty badly, unfortunately.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from Jerry Su with Credit Suisse.\n\nJerry Su -- Credit Suisse AG -- Analyst\n\nJust curious, I think for the third quarter guidance, it seems to be pretty strong, but the gross margin is still remain at the similar range or versus the previous quarter. I'm just wondering because when we look at the gross margin profile of Himax in the past, it could go to around at least low to mid-20s. I'm just wondering why in the next quarter or even with the the growth in the top line, but gross margin is still not able to see a more meaningful uplift?\n\nJordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nThat's a very good question, Jerry. Firstly, certainly, it has everything to do with the product mix, right? And if you look at our gross margin across some of our major segments. Right now, the sectors enjoying the product segments, enjoying the higher gross margins are automotive driver IC automotive display driver IC and WLO. WLO, however, depending on our capacity utilization, right? And among the lower gross margin segments include smartphone. And it's not only because of the rather severe competitive situation out there. So Q3 compared to Q2, we are not growing because Q3 similar to Q2, the smartphone as a percentage, especially for TDDI has grown remarkably from Q1, and that is actually the main reason to explain why the gross margin for both quarters are lower than that of Q1. Also, if you recall, our WLO shipment was very, very strong. And it declined rather significantly in Q2 and Q3. And again, as I said earlier, but we all enjoyed good gross margin, especially when the shipment is high, and therefore, the capacity utilization is also high. And also, the third reason, I think, is the rather sluggish automotive segment overall. And again, automotive historically and still now, and still, in any foreseeable future will be among the highest gross margin sectors for us. So I so that kind of explains the low growth, the unsatisfactory gross margin for Q2 and also Q3. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that raising gross margin is now a short term goal and that covers Q4 and certainly the whole next year. And I think we have a fairly good degree of confidence that our gross margin will recover. I think in general, foundry tightness, as you pointed out, is in general, good for design house gross margin. So I think we're going to take advantage of that, firstly. And also, I mentioned earlier, because of education decisions in Q4, tablet will grow strongly while smartphone can even suffer a decline. So for that reason, I think Q4 gross margin will also grow, among other reasons. And if you look at next year, we do have some new products in the pipeline, which [Indecipherable] production, we enjoy very, very strong gross margin, much, much higher than our corporate average, stuff like WiseEye is especially and certainly 3D business as well.\n\nJerry Su -- Credit Suisse AG -- Analyst\n\nOkay. Got it. And then one follow-up on WLO. I'm just wondering when can we see a more meaningful volume recovery for this business going forward?\n\nJordan Wu -- President, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n\nFor oh, WLO. We so far, we have been our business has been very concentrated on one anchor customer. So for that reason, I'm afraid, I really can't comment too much because that kind of imply into customers' activity [Indecipherable] your own lease, right? So and I'm not going to do that. I think what we are working very hard toward is to diversify our customer base and application. And certainly, it's the [Indecipherable] lot of R&D and customer engagement, so the lead time will be required. But we talked about our ToF engagement where we are engaged by the smartphone and customers, the world's leading sensor vendors and some of the world's leading laser vendors. So we had working together trying to put together some good solutions, especially for [Indecipherable] markets, right? So exactly that is going to happen. I can't really say because it's up to the end customer, meaning the smartphone makers to decide. But I can tell you we are making exciting progress. Can we see some volume production next year? Possibly, but nothing is certain in the pipeline yet, I have to say. But I can also say the development and also the performance thereby, is looking very exciting. And we are also expanding our coverage to other applications, including very notably, automotive. With which, again, where we are working with some of the leading say, laser drivers, among others, altogether try to penetrate to start with, for example, in automotive, in-cabin sensor in-cabin 3D sensing. So we are making good progress there as well. So and also with the anchor customer, we have quite a number of exciting but challenging joint development projects. So if you look slightly longer time horizon, I think this is a very, very exciting area. Where we can enjoy tremendous growth, but I just can't comment much on the very short term.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time.

The company is working hard to expand the camp allowing for a return to full staffing levels before the end of the third quarter. With this in mind third quarter performance is anticipated to be similar to that of the second quarter, with a return to full levels of production in the early part of the fourth quarter. Should this be achieved, full year production would be expected to be between 34,000 and 37,000 ounces.\n\nClive Line, CFO of Serabi has been interviewed by Crux Investors and BRR Media. These interviews can be accessed using the following links\n\nCrux Investors - https:\/\/youtu.be\/jHyjme-IeJo\n\nBRR Media - https:\/\/www.brrmedia.co.uk\/broadcasts-embed\/5f33db75b14d872626436cbb\/copied-from-5f292eef65023062edd7e282?popup=true\n\nClive Line, CFO of Serabi commented,\n\n\u201cThe second quarter of the year has proved, financially, to be one of our most successful ever and viewed in the context of the uncertainties that we were facing at the end of March, both from a financial and operational perspective, the workforce have produced an exceptional result in extremely challenging circumstances.\n\n\u201cCashflow generated from operations was US$5.85 million and after accounting for capital expenditures the net operational cash flow of US$4.2 million represents the best level of quarterly cash flow generated by the Company to date.\n\n\u201cOperating profit (before finance costs) of US$4.64 million, is up by 253% compared to the same quarter in 2019 and for the year to date there has been an 82% improvement year on year. The financial performance has been assisted by the strong gold price and the continued weakness of the Brazilian Real. Since the end of the quarter we have seen continued improvement in the gold price, with record highs being reached in early August, and an average gold price for this current third quarter of approximately US$1,880 to date, compared with the average price achieved for the year to date of US$1,647 per ounce. With the expectation of gold production for the third quarter being at similar levels to that of the second quarter levels, this bodes well for the Company\u2019s cash generation going forward.\n\n\u201cThe Company was able to repay the US$3.5 million outstanding secured loan liability to Sprott Resource Lending during the quarter without any impact on our cash position. In light of the operational uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic we were able to renegotiate the terms for the settlement of the final payment for the Coringa gold project and this is now being paid down, whilst there are travel restrictions in place both internationally and within Brazil, in monthly instalments. We also put in place a US$12 million Convertible Loan Note facility (the \u201cLoan Note Facility\u201d) arrangement with Greenstone Resources II LP (\u201cGreenstone\u201d), one of our major shareholders, which provided certainty that the Company had funding available to it to meet this acquisition obligation. At the end of the second quarter Serabi had drawn down US$1.5 million against the Loan Note Facility and settled US$1.0 million of the acquisition obligation. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, a further US$1.5 million of the acquisition obligation has been paid, with only US$0.5 million of additional funding being drawn down against the Loan Note Facility. With the Sprott debt now repaid and given the levels of cash currently expected to be generated, management will continue to try to pay the on-going instalment payments for Coringa from cash flow generated from operations, and minimise the requirement to make further draw-downs against the Loan Note Facility.\n\n\u201cThe cash cost per ounce and the AISC per ounce for the year to date need to be viewed in context. Gold production for the year to date has been lower than was originally forecast. In the first quarter this was the result of a breakdown of the largest of the three ball mils during February, and although we quickly bounced back and were able to report our highest ever monthly level of production for March 2020, we could not fully recover the earlier shortfall. The second quarter production has been affected by the need to reduce the workforce on site to allow socially distanced working conditions. By the end of the quarter, the Company recorded over 85 per cent of its original production estimate with just 65 per cent of the normal level of workforce at site. Those staff that were at site, voluntarily extended their work rosters. Many spent up to three months at site to maintain the mining operations as restrictions on travel and a lack of testing capacity at the time rendered team changes very difficult. However, taking this action kept the camp safe. Nevertheless, additional costs have been incurred as a result of the pandemic, including hardship payments to staff that remained at site, salary payments whilst staff were quarantining in advance of starting their work rosters and additional medical and other costs as the Company adapted the conditions in the live-in camp to the changing requirements imposed by the pandemic, ensuring that it provides, as much as possible, a safe and secure work and living environment. Had production been at the original levels expected, this would have potentially translated into a 12.5 per cent improvement in the AISC and Cash Costs.\n\n\u201cLooking at the operational statistics during the first six months of the 2020, mined tonnage and plant throughput have been at similar levels to the same period in 2019 with lower mine grades being the major contributor to the reduction in gold production. The original plan for 2020 was to increase mining rates compared with 2019, and to use the ore sorter to beneficiate the lower grade material and deliver a sorted higher grade product to the process plant. The mine plan was therefore deliberately designed to undertake more development (more diluted ore given the mining method) as well as more lower grade stopes. The intention was to beneficiate this lower grade material through the ore sorter, screen out the majority of the waste and send the resultant lower volume of higher grade product to the plant. However, despite the Company continuing to follow the original mine plan, the reduced workforce meant the mining rates could not attain budgeted levels. As we begin to return to normal mining rates during the second part of this year mine output is expected to exceed the current plant capacity and with that, the effects of the ore sorter will really come into their own. With this, I would fully expect to see unit costs coming down as we spread the costs of the operation, many of which are relatively fixed in the short term, over a growing production base.\n\n\u201cWe have re-started some of the investment programmes that were put on hold at the end of March 2020 in particular underground drilling at Sao Chico which is required for longer term mine planning purposes and orders for capital equipment to replace some of the mining fleet. Exploration programmes are expected to re-start in the fourth quarter once additional accommodation units and other infrastructure changes are installed to house and support Serabi\u2019s own full workforce complement.\n\n\u201cIt has been said before, but I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank all of our Brazilian staff and management for the efforts they have made over the recent months. They have shown a commitment, flexibility, patience and loyalty that has allowed the Company to weather this storm and emerge in a strong position and the Board of Serabi is extremely grateful for their dedication.\u201d\n\nThis announcement is inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation 596\/2014.

Basis of Preparation\n\nThese interim condensed consolidated financial statements are for the three and six month periods ended 30 June 2020. Comparative information has been provided for the unaudited three and six month periods ended 30 June 2019 and, where applicable, the audited twelve month period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the disclosures that would otherwise be required in a complete set of financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2019 annual report.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 \u201cInterim Financial Reporting\u201d and the accounting policies are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 and those envisaged for the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2020.\n\n.\n\nAccounting standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2020\n\nThe Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.\n\nThe following Accounting standard has come into effect as of 1 January 2020 have been\n\nIAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors (Amendment \u2013 Definition of Material)\n\nThe adoption of this standard has had no effect on the financial results of the Group.\n\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued that are effective in future periods and which the Group has chosen not to adopt early. None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the Group, in particular\n\nIAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nIFRS 3 Business Combinations (Amendment \u2013 Definition of a Business)\n\nThese financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006\n\nGoing concern and availability of finance\n\nAs at 30 June 2020 the Group had cash in hand of US$9.63 million and net assets of US$56.49 million.\n\nThe occurrence of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created significant uncertainty for all business sectors including Serabi. However during the second quarter of 2020, the Group has maintained its gold mining operations without interruption, albeit that the Group took the decision to reduce the levels of workforce at site as a pre-cautionary measure to improve social distancing whilst additional accommodation and other facilities could be put in place prior to a return to full workforce numbers. Whilst production levels during the second quarter of 2002 were approximately 85 per cent of the levels that the Group had originally forecast, the weakness of the Brazilian Real and the increased gold price that prevailed during the second quarter, resulted in strong cash flow being generated by the Group. This has permitted the Group to repay in full US$3.5 million of secured loan that was outstanding at 31 March 2020.\n\nAt the current time the Directors have assumed that mining operations and gold production will continue at the Palito Complex at similar levels of production for the third quarter and expect that, with a return to a full workforce during the fourth quarter, production in the fourth quarter will increase. There is no evidence, at this time, to suggest that the authorities in Brazil have any intention to try and close down or suspend mining activities as a result of the current Coronavirus pandemic. On 20 March 2020, it was stipulated in Decree 10,282\/20 that mineral activity was considered an essential business sector and further actions have subsequently been invoked to prevent any restrictive measures being applied to the supplies required by the mining industry including transportation of supplies, availability of materials required for processing, and the sale and transportation of the mineral products.\n\nThe Group has renegotiated the terms relating to the settlement of a final acquisition payment of US$12 million due to Equinox Gold Inc (\u201cEquinox\u201d) in respect of the purchase of Chapleau Resources Limited and its Coringa gold project (the \u201cCoringa Deferred Consideration\u201d). Under the revised arrangement the Group will pay monthly instalments commencing 1 May 2020 of US$500,000 per month, increasing to US$1 million per month from 1 August 2020 and payable thereafter (\u201cthe \u201cDeferral Period\u201d) until such time as certain conditions relating to travel into and within Brazil are lifted (the \u201cTravel Restriction Conditions\u201d). Within 6 weeks of the satisfaction of the Travel Restriction Conditions the remaining portion of the Coringa Deferred Consideration will become payable.\n\nThe Company announced on 22 January 2020 that it had entered into an agreement with Greenstone Resources II LP (\u201cGreenstone\u201d) for the issue of and subscription by Greenstone of US$12 million of Convertible Loan Notes the proceeds of which would be used to satisfy the Coringa Deferred Consideration. However, due to the uncertainties created by the impact of the Coronavirus, the Company and Greenstone agreed to extend the period for the satisfaction of the conditions required for completion of the subscription by Greenstone. On 24 April 2020 the Company announced that it had agreed certain amendments to the original agreement with Greenstone (the \u201cAmended Subscription Deed\u201d).\n\nUnder the Amended Subscription Deed and a further subsequent amendment agreed with Greenstone\n\n(a) the Company may, prior to the satisfaction of the Travel Restriction Condition only submit a subscription request in respect of Convertible Loan Notes in the amount of US$500,000 each month. Following the satisfaction of the Travel Restriction Condition, the Company may then issue further subscription request for amounts of not less than US$100,000 and not exceeding an amount equal to US$12,000,000 less the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Notes outstanding at that time.\n\n(b) the Convertible Loan Notes were initially unsecured and subordinated to the Sprott Loan. Following the completion of the repayment of the Sprott Loan on 30 June 2020, the security interests of Sprott have been discharged and the Company has granted to Greenstone the security package as originally envisaged save that a pledge of the shares of Chapleau Resources Limited (\u201cCRL\u201d) will continue to be held by Equinox until such time as the Coringa Deferred Consideration is settled in full. CRL holds 100% of the shares of Chapleau Explora\u00e7\u00e3o Mineral Ltda which in turn holds the exploration licences for the Coringa gold project\n\n(d) The period during which the Company may issue an Issue Notice to Greenstone expires on 30 June 2021\n\n(e) Subject to Greenstone not having exercised its option to convert the amount outstanding into Conversion Shares, the Convertible Loan Notes are due to be repaid 16 months after the first Issue Date which was 30 April 2020.\n\nBased on the performance of the Group during the second quarter, and having discharged the Sprott Loan, the Board considers, if current production levels can be maintained and gold prices remain at current levels, that the Group can generate adequate cash flow, at least in the short term, to satisfy the on-going commitment in respect of the Coringa Deferred Consideration without needing to make further drawdowns against the Convertible Loan Notes. As at the current date, US$2.0 million has been drawn down against the Convertible Loan Notes and US$9.5 million remains outstanding in respect of the Coringa Deferred Consideration.\n\nThe Balance Sheet of the Group shows a net liability position of US$0.83 million at 30 June 2020 including the fair value of a cash liability of US$11 million in respect of Coringa Deferred Consideration (reduced to US$9.5 million subsequent to the period end. The Group plans to try and finance this liability as much as possible from its operational cash flow but can also obtain additional working capital through the issue of the balance of US$12 million of Convertible Loan Notes to Greenstone which will not be repayable until 31 August 2021.\n\nWhilst the Directors consider that the assumptions they have used are reasonable and based on the information currently available to them, there remains significant uncertainty regarding further actions that have not been anticipated but which may be required or imposed and may impact on the ability of the Group to meet the operational plan and cash flow forecast.\n\nWhilst recognising all the above uncertainties, the Directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. In the event that additional short term funding is required, the Directors believe there is a reasonable prospect of the Group securing further funds as and when required in order that the Group can meet all liabilities including the Coringa Deferred Consideration as and when they fall due in the next 12 months. The Directors have been successful in raising funding as and when required in the past and consider that the Group continues to have strong support from its major shareholders who been supportive of and provided additional funding when required on previous occasions.\n\nAs at the date of this report both the medium and long term impact of COVID-19 on the underlying operations, and the outcome of raising any further funds that may be required, remains uncertain and this represents a material uncertainty surrounding going concern. If the Group fails to achieve the operational plan or to raise any additional necessary funds, the Group may be unable to realise its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The matters explained indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group and Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not show the adjustments to the assets and liabilities of the Group or the Company if this was to occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

Mr Hodgson is an Economic Geologist by training with over 26 years' experience in the mining industry.

Based on the results of this work, the Company's management are satisfied that the Company's own facility shows good correlation with independent laboratory facilities. The Company would expect that in the preparation of any future independent Reserve\/Resource statement undertaken in compliance with a recognised standard, the independent authors of such a statement would not use Palito assay results but only use assay results reported by an appropriately certificated laboratory.\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements in this announcement are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are identi\ufb01ed by their use of terms and phrases such as \u2018\u2018believe\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018could\u2019\u2019, \u201cshould\u201d \u2018\u2018envisage\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018estimate\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018intend\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018may\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018plan\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018will\u2019\u2019 or the negative of those, variations or comparable expressions, including references to assumptions.

Such forward looking statements re\ufb02ect the Directors\u2019 current beliefs and assumptions and are based on information currently available to the Directors. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements including risks associated with vulnerability to general economic and business conditions, competition, environmental and other regulatory changes, actions by governmental authorities, the availability of capital markets, reliance on key personnel, uninsured and underinsured losses and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although any forward looking statements contained in this announcement are based upon what the Directors believe to be reasonable assumptions, the Company cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with such forward looking statements.\n\nENDS\n\nAttachment"},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/science\/2020\/08\/bill-gates-on-covid-19-most-tests-are\/?comments=1","domain":"arstechnica.com","published_date":"2020-08-08 11:05:00","title":"Bill Gates on Covid-19: Most tests are","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.arstechnica.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Science_BillGates_1174744356.jpg","content":"For 20 years Bill Gates has been easing out of the roles that made him rich and famous\u2014CEO, chief software architect, and chair of Microsoft\u2014and devoting his brain power and passion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, abandoning earnings calls and antitrust hearings for the metrics of disease eradication and carbon reduction. This year, after he left the Microsoft board, one would have thought he would have relished shedding the spotlight directed at the four CEOs of big tech companies called before Congress.\n\nBut as with many of us, 2020 had different plans for Gates. An early Cassandra who warnedof our lack of preparedness for a global pandemic, he became one of the most credible figures as his foundation made huge investments in vaccines, treatments, and testing. He also became a target of the plague of misinformation afoot in the land, as logorrheic critics accused him of planning to inject microchips in vaccine recipients. (Fact check: false. In case you were wondering.)\n\nExclusive audio of Steven's interview with Bill Gates drops on the Get WIRED podcast on Monday; subscribe here to make sure you don't miss it.\n\nMy first interview with Gates was in 1983, and I\u2019ve long lost count of how many times I\u2019ve spoken to him since. He\u2019s yelled at me (more in the earlier years) and made me laugh (more in the latter years). But I\u2019ve never looked forward to speaking to him more than in our year of Covid. We connected on Wednesday, remotely of course. In discussing our country\u2019s failed responses, his issues with his friend Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s social networks, and the innovations that might help us out of this mess, Gates did not disappoint. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWIRED: You have been warning us about a global pandemic for years. Now that it has happened just as you predicted, are you disappointed with the performance of the United States?\n\nBill Gates: Yeah. There\u2019s three time periods, all of which have disappointments. There is 2015 until this particular pandemic hit. If we had built up the diagnostic, therapeutic, and vaccine platforms, and if we\u2019d done the simulations to understand what the key steps were, we\u2019d be dramatically better off. Then there\u2019s the time period of the first few months of the pandemic, when the US actually made it harder for the commercial testing companies to get their tests approved, the CDC had this very low volume test that didn\u2019t work at first, and they weren\u2019t letting people test. The travel ban came too late, and it was too narrow to do anything. Then, after the first few months, eventually we figured out about masks, and that leadership is important."},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/property\/house-prices\/soaring-property-market-wont-last-estate-agents-warn-boom-followed\/","domain":"telegraph.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-13 05:00:00","title":"Soaring property market won't last as estate agents warn of 'boom followed by bust'","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/content\/dam\/property\/2020\/07\/24\/Houses-with-graph-lines-2-1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNUHzxaamNmHDqK-YksWRz2o-yMLyYquKCawpyDOW254.jpg?imwidth=680","content":"House price growth will falter as Government support is withdrawn, estate agents have warned, with some forecasting a \u201cboom followed by a bust\u201d.\n\nA poll of members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a trade body, found that new buyer inquiries, instructions to sell properties and agreed sales all rose sharply in July.\n\nThose surveyed agreed that the stamp duty holiday had played a big role in lifting demand and adding momentum to the market.\n\nWhile they were optimistic about the level of sales and house price growth over the next three months, the outlook for a year\u2019s time was negative. By this time, the furlough scheme will have been unwound and the stamp duty holiday will have ended.\n\nSimon Rubinsohn, of Rics, said: \u201cThere remains rather more caution about the medium term outlook with the macro environment, job losses and the ending or tapering of government support measures for the sector expected to take their toll. Significantly, some contributors are now even referencing the possibility of a boom followed by a bust.\u201d\n\nAnecdotal evidence from Rics members suggested that the stamp duty holiday has fuelled the pent-up demand created by lockdown.

It was incorporated into TikTok, which became a global sensation -- particularly among younger users.\n\nThe order, set to take effect in 90 days, retroactively prohibits the acquisition and bars ByteDance from having any interest in Musical.ly.\n\nTrump ordered that any sale of interest in Musical.ly in the US had to be signed off on by the Committee on Foreign Investment, which is to be given access to ByteDance books.\n\nTikTok appointed former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, an American, as its new chief executive in May, and also withdrew from Hong Kong shortly after China imposed a controversial new security law on the city.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"},{"topic":"BUSINESS","link":"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/2020\/08\/08\/wells-fargo-value-or-value-trap.aspx","domain":"fool.com","published_date":"2020-08-08 12:00:00","title":"Wells Fargo: Value or Value Trap?","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/g.foolcdn.com\/image\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F586150%2Fwells-fargo-2.jpeg&op=resize&w=700","content":"The bank doesn't have a lot going for it right now, but it's still hard not to see this as a value investment long term.\n\nI have recently been very critical of Wells Fargo (WFC -0.53%) because I believe the company did a poor job projecting loan losses in the second quarter, which left investors and most analysts surprised when the bank reported a $2.4 billion loss. But just because you don't like the way a company went about something doesn't mean that company lacks value. While it will be a long road to recovery, I still see Wells Fargo, one of the largest banks in the U.S., having serious value in the long term.\n\nThe asset cap\n\nAfter Wells Fargo was found to have opened roughly 2 million fraudulent bank and credit card accounts, the Federal Reserve put it under an asset cap in 2018, limiting the bank to roughly $1.95 trillion in assets. This asset cap has been a nightmare for Wells Fargo, especially with the low-rate environment that saw interest rates quickly scoot back to zero in March.\n\nOne primary way that you can measure how banks make money is through the net interest margin (NIM), which is the difference between what banks pay for deposits and what they earn on loans. In a low-rate environment, because the NIM is generally smaller (although low rates also bring down deposit costs, which can help), banks lend more to offset the smaller spreads. This is normally doable because consumers want to take advantage of paying less interest. But Wells Fargo is right up against its asset cap, meaning it really won't be able to lend in the volume it needs to. The bank's NIM dropped 33 basis points (0.33%) between the first and second quarter, while the bank's net interest income dropped about $1.4 billion in that same time period.\n\nAs long as the asset cap is still in place and rates are zero -- which could be a while -- it's presumably going to be hard for Wells Fargo to generate sufficient revenue, especially if it keeps having to set aside cash to cover potential loan losses. The asset cap has now been in place for more than two years, and management hasn't been able to provide any concrete time frame for when it will be removed.\n\nBut the good news in all of this is that most investors see the asset cap as one of the main barriers blocking the company from getting back to its performance before the scandal. Once the cap is removed, the stock should see a significant bump.\n\nExpense reductions\n\nThe other good news for investors is that Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf announced on the company's recent earnings call that it plans to cut $10 billion in annual expenses. This will improve the bank's efficiency ratio, currently a whopping 81.6% (efficiency ratio measures a bank's expenses as a percentage of its revenue, so lower is better).\n\nThis could be harder than expected. While Wells Fargo has room to reduce expenses through job cuts, which are certainly coming, and branch consolidation and closures, the bank will need to maintain or possibly spend more on the regulatory side of things because of the asset cap. Bank executives have also acknowledged they need to invest heavily in technology as well.\n\nScharf, who was brought in to clean up Wells Fargo, is a good man for the job, having spent years in the earlier part of his career working with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who first made a name for himself as a cost cutter. Scharf already appears to be making progress on this front and is taking a classic page from Dimon's playbook, vowing to cut spending on outside consultants, which the bank spends $1 billion to $1.5 billion on annually, according to the Financial Times.\n\nHow long is the horizon?\n\nThe bad news is that no one really has an idea about the time frame for the asset cap. The other bad news is that Scharf, on the company's recent earnings call, wasn't exactly clear if overall expenses would be down in 2021. So Wells Fargo is certainly a long-term play.\n\nBut at Friday's close, Wells Fargo was trading at $25.07 per share, or a little more than a 20% discount to tangible book value. That's after significantly cutting its dividend and dealing with a lot of pain, including the pandemic, rates falling to zero, and dismal earnings results. So at this point, it seems like a lot of the struggles are already priced in.\n\nThe stock was trading at more than $47 per share in late February before the coronavirus really started to hammer the market (a 39% premium to tangible book value), so there should be some shorter-term recovery and upward movement as the economy rebounds and we get closer to a vaccine for COVID-19."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.dmarge.com\/2020\/08\/kevin-hart-summer-outfit-trend.html","domain":"dmarge.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 01:34:21","title":"Kevin Hart Proves Summer's Most 'Synchronous' Style Trend Is Here To Stay","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.dmarge.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/kevin-2.jpg","content":"Editors' product recommendations may earn DMARGE a commission Learn more\n\nKevin Hart punches well above his weight (quite literally, as it turns out).\n\nThe 41-year-old comedian, actor and prolific watch collector also happens to be one of the most underrated style icons in Hollywood today.

Due out 30 October, the record is an official re-recording of the band\u2019s first demo The Raging Wrath Of The Easter Bunny from 1986.\n\nA first taste of the album was supplied along with the announcement, take a listen to the 2020 version of Raping Your Mind below.\n\nDeciding that the \u201cpull of returning to full-on metal was too strong to avoid\u201d, the forces of Mike Patton, Trey Spruance and Trevor Dunn reassembled to give their early demo the \u201cmuch-needed presentation and precision it deserved\u201d.\n\nGiven the trashy metal nature of the demo, the Mr. Bungle core members decided to enlist help directly from the \u201cBig Four\u201d, and were joined by Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian and Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo. The album was recorded over a period of 10 days, sometime before COVID-19 reached pandemic status.\n\nSaid Trevor Dunn on putting together their latest studio album: \u201cRecording this record felt like we were finally utilising our PhDs in Thrash Metal. All we had to do was go back to our original professors [Scott Ian and Dave Lombardo] for some additional guidance and talk them into joining us. Turns out we were A+ students.\u201d\n\nWhile the record will include the eight tracks found on the original 1986 demo, from Grizzly Adam to Sudden Death, it also presents some new songs that weren\u2019t fleshed out at the time for release.\n\n\u201cWe even went for extra credit by revisiting some tunes that we\u2019d given up on back in the day. It was less like a trip of nostalgia and more like the refining of an original, worthy document. We were haunted for 35 years by the fact that this music wasn\u2019t given it\u2019s due respect. Now we can die.\u201d\n\nOne of the new songs, Anarchy Up Your Anus is said to feature actress Rhea Perlman, best known for playing Carla Tortelli in the sitcom Cheers.\n\nPre-orders for The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny Demo are being taken now, and the record will release 30 October in a number of digital and physical editions.

She was only 12 when Cinderella Story and Mean Girls came out, but she saw them both in theaters despite their respective PG and PG-13 ratings. She bought the new issue of J-14 magazine every month.\n\n\u201cMy mom probably spent like a million dollars buying those magazines for me,\u201d the 28-year-old, who now lives in Boston, tells InsideHook.\n\nGushue carried that obsession into adulthood: She started @literaltrash2004 in 2015, an Instagram account dedicated to paparazzi shots and magazine spreads featuring aughts icons: a pink Juicy Couture-clad Paris Hilton clutching hands with former flame Deryck Whibley or Jessica Simpson posing next to a cake emblazoned with an illustration of her face. As of today, the account has more than 36,000 followers.\n\n\u201cMy friends and I would always say to each other, \u2018You\u2019re literal trash,\u2019\u201d Gushue explains. \u201cIt just goes along with the whole kind of aesthetic: the fake tan, the bleach blonde hair, the bad extensions, the miniskirts. It all has this trashy appeal.\u201d\n\nGushue and her peers spent their adolescence and teen years worshiping at the altar of It Girls and movie stars who flamed up and then fizzled out in the grocery-store tabloids. Some of the most iconic celebrity moments emerged out of a paparazzo\u2019s flashbulb, leaving an indelible imprint on the psyche of young millennials. Lucky for them there\u2019s never been a better time to revive \u201990s and aughts nostalgia, because pop culture is currently in full-tilt throwback mode.\n\nRosewell and High Fidelity are back on our screens (though the latter was canceled earlier this week), and the Babysitters Club is a Netflix show. Celebrity supermodels are in the midst of a renaissance; the Big Five of \u201990s supermodels have been replaced by Kendall Jenner, Kaia Gerber, Cara Delivigne, and Gigi and Bella Hadid. And now, a series of accounts like Gushue\u2019s, with names like @conde.nasty, @vintagevirgin and @y2k.slut, which pay homage to on-screen idols of the past several decades, are proliferating on Instagram. Unapologetic devotees of bad fashion, high cheekbones and all things trashy, these accounts are internet shrines to celebrities like Paris Hilton, Kate Moss, Gwen Stefani and Mariah Carey.\n\nMost of these accounts have popped up in the past two years, though a few, like Gushue\u2019s, go back further. Every single account owner interviewed for this article confirmed that their followers are around 80 percent women, ranging mostly in age from 18 to 35. In other words, they are millennials clamoring to reclaim their young adulthood.\n\n\u201cThe appeal is in the nostalgia behind it. The internet can feel just toxic, with people posting pictures of themselves, you compare yourself to others. And this is a place where none of that really matters,\u201d says Hannah White. She started her account, @doyoulovethe2000s, in 2018, after re-watching The Simple Life.\n\nGushue agrees. After posting in support of Black Lives Matter on May 30, she recalls feeling conflicted about when to return to her normal content, knowing that her audience is more interested in taking a break from the news cycle than confronting it.\n\n\u201cPeople definitely follow these kinds of things to get away from reality,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause it brings back memories of when the world wasn\u2019t so chaotic.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right: These tiled glimpses into the not-so-distant past ease the particular turmoil of our current historical moment. Each account is a portal through which we momentarily trade the chaos of the Trump era for a chaotic shot of a cigarette-smoking Winona Ryder walking to her car with Brittany Murphy.\n\nBack then, fans felt earnest affection for their idols; the tone of Instagram celebrity nostalgia is just as reverential 20 years later. On today\u2019s \u201990s and aughts nostalgia Instagram pages, \u201cit\u2019s all love,\u201d says Gushue. Though she sees the humor in crotch-skimming miniskirts and a rhinestone studded Sidekick, @literaltrash2004 is supposed to be a genuine celebration of women like Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. That\u2019s a stark contrast to the reigning tone of pop culture today, which tends more toward cynicism and irony. While audiences might feel inclined to mock the era\u2019s many ridiculous and unflattering fashion trends, White sees it differently.\n\n\u201cEverything had much more personality with it, whether it was a Nokia phone case you pick out or the way you bedazzled your phone,\u201d she says. \u201cNow everyone just has the same iPhone. Back then people dressed with more personality. There weren\u2019t as many celebrity stylists back then, so a lot of people were styling themselves.\u201d\n\nNineties style is in our fashion DNA now, whether we like it or not. In fact, the boom in Instagram accounts dedicated to celebrity nostalgia from this era is happening at the same time that platforms, pleated skirts and crop tops from Friends and Clueless are hitting runways and off-duty model looks.\n\nYeraldy Nunez, a 21-year-old from Mexico, says she originally started @90sclassy because she\u2019s \u201cobsessed\u201d with \u201990s fashion, but she also wants to correct some of the whitewashing that occurred during the era. \u201cAs a Latina, it\u2019s really important for me to share my culture with my followers, so I love posting Latin icons from music and cinema like Selena Quintanilla, Gustavo Cerati, Jennifer Lopez or Salma Hayek.\u201d\n\nInstagram celebrity nostalgia is also an attempt to rewrite a slightly sordid history. The tabloids cast \u201990s and aughts celebrities as vapid, dumb, greedy, materialistic and messy. Paparazzi stalked and harassed celebrities while gossip writers ridiculed them, especially women, to the point of mental breakdown. Chris Crocker became immediately iconic when he begged the public to \u201cleave Britney alone\u201d in 2007; perhaps his pleas marked the beginning of the era of celebrity worship.\n\n\u201cThey really body-shamed women back then. It was obvious that Britney was not okay, but they made fun of her. They called her fat. And I\u2019m like, \u2018What are you even talking about?\u2019\u201d says Costa Paes. Paes grew up in the heavily Catholic Dutch province of Gelderland, and as a gay teenager found refuge in celebrity gossip sites like TMZ, where he felt like he could relate to the celebrities who stayed true to their aesthetic despite media scrutiny. Paes now runs @literally.iconic, where the celebrities on his page are revered, not ridiculed. \u201cOr I remember the People magazine cover with Heidi Montag where it says she\u2019s addicted to plastic surgery. If you did plastic surgery back then you were a mess, but right now it\u2019s so normal.\u201d\n\nThe people bringing celebrity nostalgia to Instagram are in the business of image rehabilitation. They recognize their celebrity idols as the profoundly influential, trailblazing, trendsetting women they actually were. Very few are still famous today, overtaken by viral TikTok sensations, but this is their chance to reclaim their celebrity in the digital age. Turns out their fans are just as devoted as ever.\n\nLooking back fondly on the frivolous dramas between It girls and pop stars is an escape from the much higher stakes woes of the now \u2014 as well as perhaps a vision of the future, when we all might be channeling our inner Paris Hilton, dancing on a tabletop somewhere. But it\u2019s also a reminder that we didn\u2019t do right by these women the first time around. Their social media resurrection solidifies their status as, well, literal icons, the trashy princesses who ruled our lives. We didn\u2019t forget them. And they still deserve our allegiance."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2020\/08\/new-york-film-festival-opening-night-film-lovers-rock-steve-mcqueen-director-amazon-prime-video-bbc-one-drive-in-theaters-1203002156\/","domain":"deadline.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 15:00:00","title":"New York Film Festival Sets Steve McQueen\u2019s \u2018Lovers Rock\u2019 For Opening Night; Drive-Ins, Virtual Showings To Supplement Possible Lincoln Center Screenings","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/deadline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/nyff-steve-mcqueen.jpg?crop=0px%2C33px%2C450px%2C252px&resize=681%2C383","content":"Film at Lincoln Center has set the Steve McQueen-directed Lovers Rock as the opening-night film of the 58th New York Film Festival. The film will be making its world premiere, and the festival is going heavily into the work of McQueen, who became the first Black filmmaker to win the Best Picture Oscar for 12 Years a Slave.\n\nLovers Rock is part of his Small Axe anthology, which comprises five original films by the director. Two other films from the anthology, Mangrove and Red, White and Blue, will also have their world premieres as part of the NYFF\u2019s Main Slate, the rest of which will be disclosed in the coming weeks.\n\nThis becomes the second straight year in which NYFF chose at its opening nighter a film that will be most widely viewed on a streaming service. Last year, that was the Martin Scorsese-directed The Irishman, though Netflix preceded with a theatrical bow that lasted through awards season. Every fall fest this time is navigating around a coronavirus pandemic that has placed all kinds of uncertainty for pictures eyeing theater runs this fall and is the antithesis of the communal experience that makes film festivals special as audiences discover new films together. It isn\u2019t even clear how widely attended festival premieres will be, or in the case of Toronto, whether critics and the Hollywood crowd would even be allowed across the border of Canada as the virus continues to spike in the U.S.\n\nLovers Rock will premiere on BBC One later this year and Amazon Prime Video in the U.S. Most NYFF kickoff movies have runs timed to awards season, where the genius Brit McQueen is usually encamped when he releases a film, but this is going to be a limited series play and a draw for Emmys and Golden Globes, a new one on NYFF. BBC Studios distributes internationally.\n\nOrganizers of the 58th edition of the New York Film Festival are placing a focus on social distance conscious outdoor and virtual screenings, with indoor screenings only a possibility if allowed by state and health officials. Film at Lincoln Center is partnering with arts and citywide cultural institutions from across the city this year to share films with New York City communities at two drive-ins: the Queens Drive-In at Flushing Meadows Corona Park \u2014 created by Rooftop Films, the New York Hall of Science, and Museum of the Moving Image \u2014 and the Brooklyn Drive-In at The Brooklyn Army Terminal, created by Rooftop Films and the New York City Economic Development Corporation.\n\nEvery major film fest has its own vibe, and NYFF has been distinguished by its black-tie premieres staged for wealthy patrons at its elegant upper West Side Lincoln Center venue. During the years when the fest opened with such Best Picture hopefuls as The Irishman, The Favourite, Captain Phillips, Life of Pi, Pulp Fiction, Chariots of Fire or The Social Network, had the NYFF head suggested that the festival\u2019s saving grace would be drive-in theaters\u2026 well, it would have been a collective pearl-clutching moment for the black-tie set, followed by putting the festival director under observation. But now, that endangered species of movie going, the drive-in, will be a useful partial solution to the new reality and challenge of keeping a prestige festival going under unprecedented hardship circumstances.\n\nSet from the late 1960s to the mid-1980s, McQueen\u2019s films each tell a different story involving London\u2019s West Indian community, whose lives have been shaped by their own force of will despite rampant racism and discrimination. They are produced by Turbine Studios and McQueen\u2019s Lammas Park for BBC One with Amazon Studios co-producing in the U.S. The five films that make up Small Axe are Mangrove, Lovers Rock, Alex Wheatle, Education and Red, White and Blue.\n\nLovers Rock tells a fictional story of young love and music at a blues party in the early 1980s. Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn makes her screen debut opposite the BAFTA Rising Star award recipient Micheal Ward (Top Boy). Shaniqua Okwok (Boys), Kedar Williams-Stirling (Sex Education), Ellis George (Doctor Who), Alexander James-Blake (Top Boy), Kadeem Ramsay (Blue Story) also star, as well as Francis Lovehall and Daniel Francis-Swaby, who make their screen debuts. McQueen wrote Lovers Rock with Courttia Newland.\n\nAs for the other two films, Mangrove is the true story of the Mangrove 9, a group of Black activists who clashed with London police during a protest march in 1970, and the highly publicized trial that followed. The trial was the first judicial acknowledgment of behavior motivated by racial hatred within the Metropolitan Police. Cast is headed by Letitia Wright (Black Panther), Shaun Parkes (Lost in Space), and Malachi Kirby (Curfew) star alongside Rochenda Sandall (Line of Duty), Jack Lowden (The Long Song), Sam Spruell (Snow White and the Huntsmen), Gershwyn Eustache Jnr (The Gentlemen), Nathaniel Martello-White (Collateral), Richie Campbell (Liar), Jumayn Hunter (Les Mis\u00e9rables), and Gary Beadle (Summer of Rockets). Mangrove was co-written by Alastair Siddons and Steve McQueen.\n\nRed, White and Blue spotlights the true story of Leroy Logan, who saw his father assaulted by two policemen, motivating him to join the Metropolitan Police and change their racist attitudes from within. John Boyega (Star Wars: The Force Awakens) and Steve Toussaint (Prince of Persia) star with newcomers Tyrone Huntley, Nathan Vidal and Jaden Oshenye. Red, White and Blue was co-written by Courttia Newland and Steve McQueen.\n\nMangrove and Lovers Rock are part of the Cannes 2020 Official Selection of a festival which for all practical purposes got canceled by the pandemic.\n\nSaid McQueen: \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible honor and also very humbling to show three of my films at the New York Film Festival. It\u2019s especially meaningful for me at this particular time to share these stories as a Black man of West Indian heritage. I\u2019m grateful to the NYFF for their generosity and wish everyone a safe and healthy festival.\u201d\n\nSaid NYFF Director Eugene Hernandez: \u201cIn the coming weeks we\u2019ll unveil the films our programmers have selected for the 2020 New York Film Festival. For months we\u2019ve worked to both sustain and refresh NYFF \u2014 a champion of film as art since 1963 \u2014 and we\u2019re honored that filmmaker Steve McQueen accepted our invitation to open the 58th New York Film Festival in an unprecedented manner, with one of three remarkable new films he\u2019ll unveil at NYFF.\u201d\n\nNYFF Director of Programming Dennis Lim said the director \u201creaches a new level of mastery with the Small Axe films. These are works of historical drama that speak powerfully and urgently to our present moment of reckoning over police brutality and systemic racism. They tell stories of outward struggle and inner conflict but also of everyday joy. We can\u2019t wait to share these revelatory films with audiences, and to open the festival with Lovers Rock, a celebration of Black lives as exhilarating as it is radical.\u201d\n\nAmazon Studios head Jennifer Salke said \u201cWe are proud to have Steve in our Amazon family and to be able to provide a home for his groundbreaking and relevant anthology of films, Small Axe. It\u2019s an incredible gift for us to bring such a powerful project to Prime Video. Lovers Rock, Mangrove, and Red, White and Blue shine a bright and urgent light on the courageous heroes who have stood up to fight against systemic racism; their stories are both specific and universal in their quest for equality and peace. It\u2019s the highest honor for all of us to have three of Steve\u2019s works be selected to both open and present at this year\u2019s New York Film Festival.\u201d\n\nBBC Films Director and exec producer Rose Garnett said the prime NYFF slot for McQueen\u2019s films \u201cspeaks to the urgency and brilliance of what he has created, and all of us at the BBC feel hugely proud to be part of these films. Audiences everywhere will be electrified and deeply moved by this extraordinary work.\u201d\n\nThe NYFF Main Slate selection committee, chaired by Lim, includes Hernandez, Florence Almozini, K.

Air travel demand has plunged due to travel restrictions, virus fears, and the economic disruption brought on by the pandemic. With substantial fixed costs, most airlines haven't come close to offsetting their revenue losses in 2020.\n\nIn the short run, Mexican budget airline Volaris (VLRS -1.82%) hasn't been spared from this industry downturn. That said, Volaris is sustaining far less damage than its competitors, which could help it make permanent market share gains in Mexico.\n\nA surprisingly decent first-half performance\n\nMexico was slower to shut down than many other countries. As a result, Volaris was able to grow unit revenue and improve its profitability year over year in the first quarter, logging a 3.9% operating margin.\n\nConditions deteriorated in the second quarter. In late July, Volaris reported that revenue fell more than 80% year over year last quarter on a 76.6% capacity reduction. As a result, the company posted a 2.3 billion peso ($102 million) operating loss. This brought its operating loss for the first six months of the year to 2 billion pesos ($89 million).\n\nNevertheless, Volaris was able to sharply limit cash burn last quarter by negotiating payment deferrals for various contracts and incentivizing customers to accept travel vouchers in lieu of refunds. It has also reached an agreement with Airbus to defer 20 aircraft deliveries from the next few years to 2027 and 2028, which will save $200 million of predelivery payments between 2020 and 2022. In fact, adjusted free cash flow was close to breakeven in the first half of 2020.\n\nDemand is already starting to return, particularly in the \"visiting friends and relatives\" (VFR) and leisure segments that make up the majority of Volaris' business. In August, the airline plans to operate 70% of its originally scheduled capacity: up from 11% in May, 37% in June, and 55% in July.\n\nCompetitors are in deep trouble\n\nVolaris' main rivals were much weaker coming into 2020, so they have been hurt far more by the COVID-19 pandemic. Mexican flag carrier Aeromexico filed for bankruptcy on June 30 and is using the Chapter 11 process to shrink. It has already rejected the leases for 19 aircraft, representing about 15% of its fleet. This cements Aeromexico's transition to focus almost exclusively on international travel and domestic business travel.\n\nIf anything, Interjet -- until recently the third-largest airline in Mexico -- is in even worse shape. While it hasn't filed for bankruptcy, the vast majority of its fleet has been repossessed by aircraft lessors. This has left Interjet operating a skeleton schedule. And while the company announced a $150 million capital injection last month, that may not be enough to save it. Interjet has a big pile of unpaid bills and now faces a new class action lawsuit from customers accusing it of fraud. Even if Interjet manages to avoid collapse, it will be a shell of its former self.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, Aeromexico and Interjet dominated slot-controlled Mexico City International Airport. With both incumbents shrinking, Volaris is seizing the opportunity to grow in that valuable market. It announced five new domestic routes out of Mexico City in June; three have already started service, with the other two set to begin in October.\n\nVolaris will come out stronger\n\nVolaris ended the second quarter with 10 billion pesos ($436 million) of cash on its balance sheet: nearly double the size of its debt load (excluding lease liabilities). This net cash position will enable Volaris to be aggressive and capitalize on rivals' weaknesses to make long-term market share gains.\n\nThat's not to say management will be foolhardy. Volaris is taking a relatively cautious approach to growth in the current market environment. It currently expects to end 2020 with 87 aircraft in its fleet -- up from 82 at the beginning of the year -- and to maintain its fleet at that size until at least 2023. Previously, the budget airline had planned to expand its fleet to 105 aircraft by the end of 2022.\n\nStill, this means that Volaris will be larger over the next few years than it was in 2019, whereas its two main rivals will be significantly smaller (and Interjet could shut down entirely). Moreover, once demand returns in earnest, Volaris should be able to pivot back to aggressive growth quickly.\n\nLast year, Volaris posted a $122 million pre-tax profit, excluding exchange rate fluctuations. With a net cash position and a market cap below $600 million, Volaris stock is primed to fly higher as the pandemic recedes in the years ahead."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.ndtv.com\/entertainment\/raksha-bandhan-2020-a-sister-special-rakhi-for-malaika-arora-kriti-sanon-taapsee-pannu-ananya-panday-2273411","domain":"ndtv.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 10:46:32","title":"Raksha Bandhan 2020: A Sister-Special Rakhi For Malaika Arora, Kriti Sanon, Taapsee Pannu, Ananya Panday","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/c.ndtvimg.com\/2020-08\/np8ib3s8_kriti-instagram_625x300_03_August_20.jpg?downsize=773:435","content":"On Raksha Bandhan, while social media is flooded with celebs wishing their brothers, a bunch of stars also celebrated their sisters, setting major sibling goals - actresses Malaika Arora, Ananya Panday, Taapsee Pannu and Kriti Sanon are among those celebs.

He also criticized the fact that it took several petitions and Rachel Lindsay, the series\u2019 first Black \u201cBachelorette\u201d lead, threatening to quit for change to occur in casting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s atrocious,\u201d Johnson, 32, said to Variety in regards to the years without a diverse lead. \u201cThere have been numerous, wonderful Black and indigenous people of color that could have been cast in the lead roles, and for the franchise to not to do that, it\u2019s just terrible.\u201d\n\n\u2018BACHELORETTE\u2019 STAR RACHEL LINDSAY SAYS SHE USED TO BE \u2018SO AGAINST\u2019 DATING OUTSIDE OF HER RACE\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt should not have taken an outcry from the fans, who I absolutely adore \u2014 that was a clear sign that there is power in numbers, so I love the fans who signed petitions and things like that, but it shouldn\u2019t have taken that. I hope that they do listen. And I hope that it\u2019s not just the leads and contestants, but people in charge should also be diverse, as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 to be a representation of America. It\u2019s supposed to be about love, and love comes in all forms and colors \u2014 not just White America,\u201d the Air Force veteran said. \u201cIf the show wants to continue to be absolutely amazing, I would want it to not only be the poster child for the show with \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 or \u2018Bachelorette\u2019 who is diverse, but also people from the top down, so the contestants feel like they can relate to someone on the show.

Shortly after, James, 28, who had never been on \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d was announced as the first Black \u201cBachelor.\u201d\n\n'BACHELOR' FRANCHISE ALUMS SIGN PETITION URGING SHOW TO CAST A BLACK LEAD\n\nLindsay has criticized the timing of the announcement and Johnson agreed.\n\n\u201cWe were all talking about Clare [Crawley] being \u2018The Bachelorette,\u2019 and before her season had even aired, we bring on a different Bachelor? That the timing was definitely off. I think everyone can agree with that,\u201d the \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d alum said.\n\nJohnson continued: \u201cAt the time that they said it, it was peculiar. It wasn\u2019t natural. It was forced.

It just felt very forced to me.\u201d\n\nRegardless, Johnson gave his best wishes to Adams, 29, and said, \u201cI\u2019m obviously a proponent for representation \u2014 if she\u2019s the new \u2018Bachelorette,\u2019 which it seems almost certain that she is \u2018Bachelorette\u2019 \u2014 this is wonderful.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn regards to James, Johnson said, \u201cI am happy that it\u2019s Matt.

Depending on how the future plays out, one of them might be the reunion of a famed group.\n\nRuby Riott and Liv Morgan finally sorted out their differences to reform the Riott Squad. It might not be the biggest talking point coming out of Monday Night Raw, but it certainly signifies an effort from the creative team to create compelling stories even in ancilliary feuds.\n\nBelieve it or not, it was Kevin Owens who played the arbiter between the two fighting friends. To be honest, Owens himself has a poor record when it comes to valuing friendships.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nInterestingly, that\u2019s what he used in his quest to reunite the two on the Kevin Owens Show. Owens explained how he has not been the best person when it comes to maintaining relationships.\n\nHe always gave primacy to his career, which is something he now regrets. Even then, Morgan looked reluctant to reignite the Riott Squad.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Iconics played a helping hand. The ever-annoying tag team decided that it was a good idea to come out and deride Riott and Morgan.\n\nAfter some back and forth, both of the Iconics slapped Owens across his face. The Prizefighter asked Morgan and Riott for help, who happily obliged. Thus, The Riott Squad was back in business.\n\nAn impromptu match was set up between the two teams which the Riott Squad won after a roll up pin by Liv Morgan.\n\nWWE did a brilliant job at building this up\n\nYou have to give it up for Kevin Owens. Even though he isn\u2019t being given a proper story to play with, he makes the best out of whatever is at hand.\n\nDuring this segment, his promo about his terrible record at friendships had the viewers immediately invested. That really helped in making people care about The Riott Squad reunion, which wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise.\n\nWhat\u2019s even better was that there was a common thread running through the show. In his conversation backstage with Ric Flair, Owens extended his promo saying that he wanted to reimagine his role in the locker room.\n\nNow, he wanted to be someone that the new guys can come to for advise. Not like Randy Orton who was completely unapproachable.\n\nHence, it added further legitimacy to Drew McIntyre\u2018s passionate promo calling out Orton for his arrogance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nIn the best way possible, a match has been set for next week between Randy Orton and Kevin Owens.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m all in for this style of storytelling. It helps to have a purpose and story behind every match. That makes the viewers log in week after week to know what happens next.\n\nUltimately, that translates to better ratings. Just by some committed writing, the creative has us pumped up for both the Riott Squad and the McIntyre-Orton-Owens saga.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nSOURCE: WWE Twitter"},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/wwd.com\/beauty-industry-news\/skin-care\/alicia-keys-beauty-brand-elf-cosmetics-1203694278\/","domain":"wwd.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 20:12:32","title":"Alicia Keys Launching Beauty Brand With Elf Cosmetics \u2013 WWD","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/wwd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/alicia-keys-.jpg?crop=3px%2C76px%2C3252px%2C1820px&resize=1000%2C563","content":"Alicia Keys has partnered with E.l.f. Beauty to launch a \u201clifestyle beauty\u201d brand, the company said on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been wanting to do something in beauty and wellness for quite some time,\u201d said E.l.f. chief executive officer Tarang Amin in an interview. He was mum on the details of the launch, declining to talk about the brand\u2019s name, specific products or retail distribution plan, but he did say the brand will encompass multiple beauty categories and Keys has been involved in the creative process for about nine months.\n\nA company statement describes the project as \u201ca culmination of Keys\u2019 personal skin-care journey\u201d and notes the line will include \u201cskin-loving, dermatologist-developed, cruelty-free products.\u201d It will launch in 2021.\n\n\u201cWhat really appealed to us is she\u2019s much more than a celebrity, she\u2019s someone of real substance who goes between being a 15-time Grammy Award winner and artist [and] she\u2019s got a New York Times bestseller in her book, \u201cMore Myself.\u201d This was really a great marriage between what she stands for and wants to accomplish in beauty and wellness and what we stand for,\u201d Amin said.\n\nKeys\u2019 beauty line will have \u201ca very strong digital presence,\u201d Amin said, but will also partner with certain retailers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much more than just the products. She has such important messaging on inclusivity, empowerment, wellness, self care, rituals \u2014 so really being able to bring all those elements out in rich storytelling is a key part of what this brand is going to be about,\u201d Amin added.\n\nThe brand will be wholly owned by E.l.f., Amin said, and Keys will become a shareholder.\n\nFor E.l.f., the news of the Keys partnership came at the same time as the company released quarterly earnings. While many beauty brands have struggled and seen business downturns as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, E.l.f.\u2019s numbers are up.\n\nFor the quarter ended June 30, E.l.f. posted an 8 percent year-over-year increase in net sales, to $64.5 million. Upticks in online sales led to a gross margin expansion of 500 basis points, Amin said. Net income was $1.5 million, or 3 cents per diluted share.\n\nAmin attributed the growth to benefit from government stimulus programs and digital strength.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen a shift online,\u201d he said, noting that online sales made up 11 percent of the company\u2019s total for fiscal 2020, but that already in the quarter ended June 30, online sales made up 17 percent of total sales.\n\nSkin care, too, has seen growth, Amin added, though core makeup items including Poreless Putty Primer and Camo Concealer are still selling.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re buying what we call our holy grail first-to-mass products,\u201d Amin said. Skin-care sales made up 25 percent of all direct online sales for the quarter, Amin added, noting that as a portion of the overall business, skin care is about 9 percent.\n\nAsked about E.l.f.\u2019s interest in hair, a category that has done well during the pandemic, Amin noted that the E.l.f. lines are likely to stay focused on skin and makeup for now, but that Keys\u2019 line will span categories.\n\nThe company declined to provide financial guidance, citing uncertainty related to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to continue to be volatile,\u201d Amin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a slowdown, even recently just with the surge in COVID-19 cases and as stimulus dollars dry up.\u201d\n\nFor more from WWD.com, see:"},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.pep.ph\/lifestyle\/parenting\/153210\/kc-montero-wife-expecting-baby-boy-a722-20200811","domain":"pep.ph","published_date":"2020-08-11 12:55:00","title":"KC Montero, wife Stephanie Dods expecting a baby boy","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.summitmedia-digital.com\/logo-dpo-dps.png","content":"KC Montero and Stephanie Dods are going to be parents soon, and they are expecting a baby boy.\n\nKC announced the baby news via a short video clip posted across his social media platforms.\n\nAccompanying the video was a love letter, which KC dedicated to his beauty queen wife.\n\nThe celebrity host praised Stephanie's \"strength and light,\" especially as she is \"growing another life\" in her womb.\n\nHe thanked her for the sacrifices, big and small, and for her patience.\n\nMost of all, KC thanked Stephanie for making him a father.\n\nPublished as is, KC's caption read: \"Dear Stephanie.

Johnny Depp, the horrors are moving to the movie screen.\n\nAs the superstar's lurid libel case against Britain's The Sun newspaper comes to a close after weeks of startling revelations about his life and toxic relationship with former wife Amber Heard, Depp's torturous movie role in \"Waiting for the Barbarians\" is released Friday (on digital and VOD).\n\nDepp's brutal Col. Joll is aided by thug-enabling Officer Mandel (Robert Pattinson) in conducting abusive interrogations and raids against \"barbarians\" in a fictional outpost overseen by the Magistrate (Mark Rylance).\n\nHere's what you need to know about Depp's performance in the screen adaptation of Nobel Prize-winning author J.M. Coetzee\u2019s 1980 novel.\n\nJohnny Depp vs. Amber Heard:All the nasty bits of the UK trial \u2014 and it's all nasty\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n'Barbarians' makes for difficult watching\n\nThis is no Tim Burton movie. Joll wreaks havoc among the peaceful indigenous people in the not-rated \"Barbarians,\" a searing political, anti-imperialism allegory.\n\n\"Pain is truth; all else is subject to doubt,\" Joll says dryly of his ghastly interrogation methods.\n\nThe fussy bureaucrat imprisons innocent people, torturing them in unspeakable ways. Much of this is featured unflinchingly by director Ciro Guerra.\n\nAfter one expedition, Joll returns to the outpost with prisoners horrifyingly tethered together with a wire that runs through their hands and cheeks. Joll then extols the townspeople to take part in the torture, revealing a gleaming gold hammer for striking a victim.\n\nThe hammer, taken from the novel, is the final straw for the Magistrate, who cries out, \"No, not with a hammer, you would not use a hammer on a beast.\" His imploring fails to stop the carnage. He's imprisoned and tortured.\n\n\"Barbarians\" runs for one hour, 54 minutes.\n\nDepp's sunglasses are not a Hollywood effect\n\nJoll is introduced on-screen stepping out of his carriage with remarkably odd sunglasses, which immediately bewilder the Magistrate.\n\n\"They protect ones eyes from the glare of the sun, they keep one from squinting,\" Joll explains in a clipped British accent.\n\nCoetzee's novel starts with a description of Joll's glasses, which serve as an effective symbol to his situational blindness. The film's wire glasses were designed \"based on extensive research in the British Museum of glasses from every age and every part of the world,\" producer Michael Fitzgerald tells USA TODAY over email. \"The ones we picked were otherworldly, but not nearly as strange as some we saw.\"\n\nDuring the \"Barbarians\" 2019 Venice Film Festival premiere, Depp said the glasses helped him to get into character. \"They were threatening, they were menacing somehow,\" he said during the film's press conference.\n\nJoll and Mandel sport flowing capes and immaculate uniforms as members of the Empire's powerful Third Bureau.\n\n\"They are dark, crisp and precise,\" Fitzgerald says. \"Uniforms for bureaucrats and torturers. Believers who will gouge your eyes out but would much rather be at the opera in the capital.\"\n\nThe ending is altered for screen, but doesn't go well for Depp's Joll\n\nJoll's blindness and terrible actions backfire on the Third Bureau, whose troops are slaughtered. In the novel, the Magistrate is able to confront the retreating Joll with the line, \"The crime that is latent within us we must inflict on ourselves... not on others.\"\n\n\"Perfect on the page. But only on the page,\" Fitzgerald says. The film's ending is slightly different, but emphasizes the same point with the utterly defeated look in Joll's eyes.\n\n'Barbarians' has approached quietly\n\nDepp dominates the film's credits with the most listings \u2013 his own sound technician and make-up artist, one executive assistant, two assistants (Rylance and Pattinson each had one assistant total) and two security team members.\n\nBut we haven't heard much from Depp after he went to Venice to support the film's world premiere. Perhaps due to his current legal situation, he has not done any promotion for \"Barbarians.\" His performance has received mixed reviews while critics have given the stunningly shot film a 50% freshness rating on the aggregate site RottenTomatoes.com.\n\n."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/life-style\/life\/1321797\/how-to-sleep-hot-cant-heat-keep-cool-at-night","domain":"express.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-12 08:23:27","title":"How to keep cool at night: Too hot to sleep?

According to Disney, it's the galaxy's \"most cheerful and magical holiday,\" so on November 17, the company will celebrate the event on Disney+ with a Lego Star Wars Holiday Special. Set immediately after The Rise of Skywalker, Rey and BB-8 go on a journey through the nine-film timeline that promises to give screen time to goodies and baddies current and past. Except it's all done in Lego, so painted tongues will be firmly in plastic cheeks.\n\nI've been a huge fan of the more irreverent take that Lego brings to the Star Wars universe since the cut scenes in Lego Star Wars II\u2014whose heart wouldn't melt when Darth Vader whips out a Polaroid to prove to Luke that he's really his dad? And the more recent Lego Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures stands head and shoulders above Star Wars Resistance, at least to this middle-aged nerd.\n\nAll of this gives me faith that this new special won't suck. The original Star Wars Holiday Special is widely reviled by fans as the single worst thing to have come from that far, far away galaxy. It was a TV special aired in 1978, long before George Lucas' swashbuckling in space had become the cultural behemoth we know today. The plot involves Han and Chewie visiting Kashyyyk to celebrate Life Day, where apparently they meet his dad (called Itchy) and his son (called Lumpy). I say \"apparently\" because it never aired in the UK where I grew up, so I was mercifully spared as a child and I've never quite had a big enough masochistic streak to track down a copy in the decades that have followed.\n\nObviously, none of it is canon, but then neither are the Lego Star Wars adventures, so continuity be damned."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.cinemablend.com\/news\/2551981\/whats-going-on-with-tron-and-other-future-attractions-at-disneyland-and-disney-world-in-the-time-of-covid","domain":"cinemablend.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 12:21:00","title":"What's Going On With Tron And Other Future Attractions At Disneyland And Disney World In The Time Of COVID","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net\/6ks74PipXjWMb9jejE7sM3.jpg","content":"While most Disney theme parks around the world are now open for business, it's clear that it's going to be a long time before things get back to anything resembling normal. Disneyland in Anaheim and Hong Kong are closed, and even the parks that are open are only running at a fraction of capacity. As such, income from those parks is going to be drastically cut for the foreseeable future, which means that Walt Disney Imagineering is likely going to be re-evaluating a lot of plans for even the already-announced attractions at Disneyland and Walt Disney World.\n\nRecently, Walt Disney Imagineering head Bob Weiss spoke with Disney's D23 Fan Club publication and confirmed that some new attractions are likely going to be a bit further off than they were originally planned to be. He singled out a pair of new attractions, the new Tron coaster at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Disneyland's version of Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway, to say they are going to be moving at a slower pace for at least a while, while others could be delayed even further. According to Weiss:\n\nWhile several projects, like Avengers Campus\u2014at both Disney California Adventure and Disneyland Paris\u2014are able to surge forward based on where we were in development, there are others that will be picked back up in stages\u2014like Mickey & Minnie\u2019s Runaway Railway and TRON\u2014and some that are longer-term that we will need more time to assess.\n\nWhile it's not exactly clear what \"in stages\" means in this case, we can certainly understand it to mean that, while both of these projects will move forward, they won't be working at exactly the same pace they were before the shutdown of the parks. And with that, we can assume they'll both be opening later than Walt Disney Imagineering was planning. Now, in both cases, these attractions didn't have opening dates announced yet, so from the outside, we won't necessarily see the delay, but it likely will be there.\n\nCurrently Delayed Attractions At Walt Disney World And Disneyland\n\nThe closest thing that Tron Lightcycle Power Run had for an opening date was an expectation it would be open for Walt Disney World and Magic Kingdom's 50th anniversary in 2021. It still seems likely it will open sometime next year, even if it ends up happing later in the year than planned.\n\nThese aren't the only attractions that have been delayed due to the pandemic situation and its fallout. Walt Disney World has already confirmed that the announced redesign of Spaceship Earth and a planned new Mary Poppins attraction at Epcot have both been postponed and will not be part of the current Epcot redesign that is currently underway.\n\nDisney California Adventure's Avengers Campus was given a July opening date back in March right before things shut down, so we know that new land is close to being complete and will likely be opening in fairly short order once that park is able to open again. However, with no idea when the Disneyland Resort will even be able to begin a phased reopening of the parks, Avengers Campus is still off in the ether someplace.\n\nThe Disneyland And Walt Disney World Attractions We Don't Know About\n\nOf course, beyond these near and medium-term attractions, Bob Weiss mentioned the longer-term items that will need more time to assess. We know that one of these long term attractions is the redesigned Splash Mountain, which, despite being announced, is still in its very early stages. While that one is the redesign of an existing attraction, rather than a 'build from scratch', the redesign is extensive, so it will certainly take time. Another attraction that's expected to be open next year, Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind at Epcot, wasn't mentioned, so it's unclear what the state of that attraction is. It's been under construction for some time and is likely close to being completed, but we don't know for sure.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nWhat other longer-term projects Bob Weiss could be talking about, we don't even know. He could be referring to projects that haven't even been publicly announced yet, but are being worked on internally. Odds are a lot of those sorts of ideas are going to be assessed not only to figure out when they might happen, but if. While the newly reopened Walt Disney World and Disneyland Shanghai are reportedly profitable for Disney in an absolute sense, they certainly aren't bringing in the same money they used to. With Disneyland Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland closed, that lack of revenue is compounded. The fact is that even in a best-case scenario, we're looking at a long road back to where we were for the parks, so many projects could get scrapped, or at the very least paired down to a less expensive version of themselves.\n\nWith the Mary Poppins and Spaceship Earth sections of the current Epcot Experience presentation seen in the park gone, but the rest still intact, that would seemingly indicate that the rest of the current Epcot construction, including a Moana-themed attraction, a new nighttime spectacular and more, will go forward as announced, both in scope and timing, but it's certainly possible that will change as well. The nighttime spectacular HarmoniUS was scheduled to begin in October, and it's possible that it could still be ready to go by then, but nighttime shows are currently on hold at the parks to prevent crowds gathering, and it seems unlikely that will change by October.\n\nStar Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, the new hotel\/immersive Star Wars experience at Walt Disney World, is still officially scheduled to open in 2021, but one has to wonder how a new hotel will operate if we're still social distancing when construction is complete. Considering how communal the experience seems to be when it's been described, it feels like a lot of what was planned for the Galactic Starcruiser might not work unless strangers are allowed to be close together. Could we see changes in what is planned, which could potentially delay construction? Or alternatively, could the Starcruiser need to wait to open until it's considered safe? At this point, it's probably too early to tell either way.\n\nThe Future Of Disneyland And Walt Disney World\n\nEvery indication is that theme parks are in for a difficult time for the next few years. Even assuming the health and safety concerns that are keeping some people away fade away sooner rather than later, expectations are that we'll be climbing out of the financial repercussions for years. Attendance at theme parks will likely be down long term because many who might otherwise visit simply won't be in a financial position to do so.\n\nWith the parks going through long term financial hardship, that's a recipe for a down period at places like Walt Disney World and Disneyland. We may go for a long time without any major new attractions because the money simply isn't there. At the same time, spending the money on big new attractions might help draw in those people on the fence and help get more guests to the parks spending money.\n\nHopefully, some happy medium can be found. While many hardcore Disney Parks fans tend to be critical when they see Disney intentionally saving money, sometimes constraints breed creativity, and we end up with solutions to problems that might not have been considered otherwise."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/deadline.com\/2020\/08\/apple-orders-drama-series-from-team-downey-adam-perlman-1203005117\/","domain":"deadline.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 19:07:00","title":"Apple Orders Drama Series From Team Downey & Adam Perlman","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/deadline.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/robert-downey-jr-adam-perlman.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1","content":"Apple has given a straight-to-series order to a drama series from Robert Downey Jr. and Susan Downey\u2019s Team Downey and Adam Perlman.\n\nBased on true events, the Untitled Team Downey and Adam Perlman project is based on Michael Lista\u2019s Toronto Life article \u201cThe Sting.\u201d It follows a frustrated Canadian detective who takes on a decades-old cold case in hopes of winning a confession and becoming a hero.

The top 10 contestants along with their choreographers are giving their best performances, who are reviewed by the judges \u2013 Geeta Kapur , Malaika Arora , and Terence Lewis . This weekend, India\u2019s Best Dancer will celebrate Azadi special to mark the occasion of Independence Day and welcome Sonu Sood , who has become the messiah of migrants and helped people across the country with his noble gestures.One special act which stole everyone\u2019s heart and made the judges, the hosts and Sonu Sood emotional was that of contestant Shweta Warrier, who hails from Kerala, with choreographer Bhavna. The two performed on the song \u2018Tu Na Jaane Aas Paas Hai Khuda\u2019 which depicted the story of a pregnant migrant worker who was stuck during the earlier months of the pandemic and decided to walk back to her hometown. A similar incident happened in real life, and that\u2019s when Sonu Sood stepped up to help this pregnant woman. As the actor learnt about this incident, he helped her to get to her destination. Shweta and Bhavna\u2019s performance made everyone emotional and Sonu Sood gave them a standing ovation.A teary eyed Sonu revealed, \u201cI have seen this situation in real life and the act was indeed beautifully portrayed. I have spoken to many pregnant women and women with children who are merely two-three days old, during these challenging times and the only thing they would ask me was if I can help them get back home. They have safely reached their homes and till date they send me photographs. It was an unreal experience. I believe that I am a different person now than I was three months back. I get thousands of messages, mails, and I try to reach out to as many people. I feel everyone should come forward and help in whatever way they can. It is very important, only then our nation can come out of this situation. This performance took me back to those times, I don\u2019t want this situation to ever occur again. Thank you for your act.\u201dAn emotional Geeta Ma said, \u201cYou have done a lot for people, I bless you and your family. So many people have reached home safely because of you. I would want to thank you on behalf of all those people. And thank you Shweta and Bhavna for showing us this beautiful act.\u201d Furthermore, Malaika, who got emotional, thanked Sonu for his work, and said, \u201cSonu has worked selflessly and tirelessly to reach out to people in need just like the frontline workers, policemen and healthcare workers. I am happy and proud to say that I know Sonu Sood. Coming back to the act, I wasn\u2019t expecting this kind of an amazing act. While Sonu saw these things happening live over the past four months, you explored these moments through your act, you have moved us and made us emotional. That is the power of dance. I feel so happy to see the girl power on the show.\u201dTo Sonu Sood\u2019s surprise, India\u2019s Best Dancer team reached out to the woman from Bihar on whom the act was based. In the video call, the parents spoke about Sonu\u2019s sweet gesture and even named their child after him. The child is called Sonu Chaudhary, and they gave a glimpse of the child on the video call. Sonu got emotional on seeing the child and speaking to his parents."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/soapdirt.com\/90-day-fiance-nicole-nafziger-leaves-morocco-confirmed-may-finally-gets-mom-back\/","domain":"soapdirt.com","published_date":"2020-08-09 14:02:00","title":"'90 Day Fiance': Nicole Nafziger Leaves Morocco - Confirmed - May Finally Gets Mom Back","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/eadn-wc01-4272485.nxedge.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/90-Day-Fiance-Nicole-Nafziger-8912-800x445.jpg","content":"90 Day Fiance single mom Nicole Nafziger is finally on her way back to her daughter after leaving Azan Tefou. Most fans criticized her lengthy stay in Morocco and that Nicole chose to remain away from her daughter for five months. But now, she\u2019s finally heading home.\n\n90 Day Fiance: Nicole Nafziger Claimed She Was Stuck \u2013 Relied on Click Bait for Cash?\n\nIt was March of this year when Nicole Nafziger hopped a plane to Morocco. The timing of her exit was peculiar since by then, everyone knew COVID-19 was a problem, and lockdowns and travel restrictions had begun. Yet, Nicole managed to fly into Azan\u2019s homeland before his country closed its borders.\n\nOnce there, Nicole from 90 Day Fiance teased fans by posting old photos of her with Azan. That came after she promised her followers she would vlog the trip. When days turned into weeks and weeks turned into months and Nicole Nafziger remained away from her daughter, fan criticism hit a fever pitch.\n\nTo further annoy her followers, Nicole Nafziger filled her social channels with clickbait ads, much of it taking aim at other 90 Day Fiance stars. One in particular that angered fans saw Nicole profiting off news of the death of Angela Deem\u2019s mother. Meanwhile, Nicole claimed she was stuck and couldn\u2019t come home. But was that true?\n\nMany Flights Back to US Offered \u2013 She Missed Them All \u2013 May Without her Mom\n\nOf course, May Nafziger was never in any danger from her 90 Day Fiance mom leaving her behind for so long. That\u2019s because Nicole Nafziger left her with her mom, Robbalee Fouraker. But, that doesn\u2019t mean May did not miss her mom \u2013 or that it was the best parenting choice. However, we confirmed with the US Embassy that she could have come home.\n\nWhen travel began locking down in Morocco, starting in March, the US Embassy offered repatriation flights to US citizens. These continued through late July. So, Nicole Nafziger could have got on a plane and left her 90 Day Fiance Azan to be with her daughter. What\u2019s more, the US government would let Nicole fly for no money up-front.\n\nThe low-cost flights were available on a fly now, pay later basis. So, it doesn\u2019t seem like any US citizen, including Nicole Nafziger, was \u201cstuck\u201d without a way back. Now, the 90 Day Fiance alum is finally coming home. But, another quick check with the embassy shows that Nicole may only be on a plane now because she was forced out of Azan\u2019s country.\n\n90 Day Fiance Visa Expired \u2013 Nicole Left With 1 Day to Spare\n\nWhen Nicole Nafziger came to Morocco, her visa allowed a 90 day stay. That term expired in June since she traveled there in March. However, because of COVID concerns, the North African country extended all foreign visas. Now, with commercial flights resuming and restrictions easing, they\u2019ve called in all expired visas.\n\nReportedly, Nicole Nafziger\u2019s visa expires on Monday, August 10. And if she stayed past then in Morocco, she\u2019d be fined. So, based on embassy info, it looks like 90 Day Fiance celeb Nicole stayed as long as she possibly could, despite available affordable flights sponsored by the US government.\n\nConfirmed \u2013 Nicole Flew Out of Morocco Today \u2013 Fan Spotted Her at Airport\n\nYou can see from the 90 Day Fiance fan photo above, that Nicole Nafziger was definitely flying out of Casablance airport this morning. Some critics alleged that she was not really in N. Africa and returned home weeks ago. However, she put all that to rest this morning by chronicling her journey \u2013 and with this well-timed fan encounter.\n\nNow, with a 14-hour flight ahead of the 90 Day Fiance traveler, Nicole should be in the US early Monday morning. That means May Nafizger only faces one more night\u2019s sleep without her mother after months apart. This weekend, May enjoyed a trip to Disney World (in a mask) with her aunt, so at least she\u2019s having fun. We\u2019ll update you on the reunion soon.\n\nGet all your 90 Day Fiance news from us at Soap Dirt daily."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/dailypost.ng\/2020\/08\/11\/bbnaija-2020-what-nigerians-are-saying-about-laycon-kiddwaya-erica-love-triangle\/","domain":"dailypost.ng","published_date":"2020-08-11 09:39:41","title":"BBNaija 2020: What Nigerians are saying about Laycon, Kiddwaya, Erica love triangle","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/dailypost.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/kid.jpg","content":"The love triangle between Erica-Laycon- Kiddwaya seems to have brought tension to Big Brother Naija, BBNaija \u2018Lockdown\u2019 edition.\n\nIt has been from one advice to another from housemates to Laycon after Erica turned him down and chose Kiddwaya.\n\nAccording to Erica, she is mentally attracted to Laycon and physically attracted to Kiddwaya.\n\nErica, who emerged Head of House for the week, also chose her love interest, Kiddwaya, as her deputy even though Laycon was in her head moments before she was called by Biggie to make a decision.\n\nThis has got BBNaija fans talking about the love triangle as some assume Laycon\u2019s attitude is his strategy to gain votes because he has a relationship outside the house.\n\nHowever, some fans have blamed Erica.\n\nHere are some comments gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter:\n\n@Pokahuntaz \u201c Seems to me like an obsession.

Slumdog Millionaire star Freida Pinto will headline and produce the project, executive produced by Michael Edelstein under his first-look deal with Miramax.\n\nPrimetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All\n\nPublished by HarperCollins\/MIRA in March, the novel was Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Hello Sunshine Book Club Pick of the Month in May. Miramax and Edelstein landed the rights in a competitive situation.\n\nCourtesy of Garry Bailey\n\nThe Henna Artist centers on 17-year old Lakshmi, who escapes from an abusive marriage and makes her way alone to the vibrant 1950s pink city of Jaipur. There, she becomes the most highly requested henna artist \u2014 and confidante \u2014 to the wealthy women of the upper class. But trusted with the secrets of the wealthy, she never can reveal her own.\n\n\u201cAlka has crafted a beautiful story of independence, family, heartbreak and success, led by a captivating heroine with an indomitable spirit, and we are very excited to collaborate with Alka, Michael and Freida to bring this extraordinary journey to the screen,\u201d said Miramax head of worldwide television Marc Helwig.\n\nPinto, who produces through her Freebird Films, and Edelstein first met years ago in an ashram in Dehradun, a small town in Northern India. Part of The Henna Artist takes place in a location not far from the town of the duo\u2019s chance encounter.\n\nWhile the two had discussed other potential projects over the years, Edelstein said that the moment he started reading The Henna Artist, he thought of Pinto.\n\n\u201cIt was clear to me from the first chapter that Freida was born to play Lakshmi,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately, the project is blessed that not only is Freida a brilliant actress, but she is the perfect producing partner to help bring this project from book to screen.\u201d\n\nEdelstein Miramax\n\nIn addition to her perspective as a woman born and raised in India, Pinto is bringing to the project her deep connections in the Indian film community. A search is underway for a writer to pen the adaptation, and, in addition to Hollywood names, the producers are considering new voices out of India, many of them pitched by Pinto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to get somebody who understands that world,\u201d Edelstein said.\n\nReading the book, Pinto immediately was drawn to Lakshmi, \u201cthe kind of character I\u2019d been dying to seek my teeth into.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs an actress, I cannot wait to dive back into the stories of my motherland and make my women (and my men) of all backgrounds, with all their good and their complexities, feel seen and heard,\u201d she said. \u201cLakshmi Shastri is not a puritanical woman. She empowers me, and I am honored to pass that feeling on to a very global audience.\u201d\n\nA big draw for Pinto was the fact that The Henna Artist features \u201ca world that hasn\u2019t been explored when it comes to India, especially in a global platform.\u201d While poverty is \u201ca topic that a lot of the global market veers to when they think of India, this book feels such a celebration of womanhood and feminism,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cIf I had to portray an India starting in 2020 and on, this is the India I\u2019d love for the world to get introduced to.\u201d\n\nBoth Pinto and Edelstein are high on the book\u2019s potential as a TV series.\n\n\u201cThe Henna Artist has tremendous potential to become that bingeable, high-quality, multilayered television show that honours the glory and beauty of India, its culture and its people,\u201d Pinto said.\n\nEdelstein drew parallels to the hugely successful Downton Abbey, which he oversaw as NBCUniversal International Studios president. Joshi, who said she was confident that Miramax, Edelstein and Pinto \u201cwill treat the material with sensitivity, intelligence and heart,\u201d is already working on a followup to The Henna Artist, creating a blueprint for future seasons.\n\n\u201cThe book is incredibly rich, the character of Lakshmi and the supporting characters around her,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this could be the type of show like Downton Abbey that could go on for many seasons.\u201d\n\nThe book was repped in the deal by The Gotham Group."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/news\/uknews\/12326678\/prince-charles-hardworking-royal-coronavirus\/","domain":"thesun.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-06 15:18:00","title":"Prince Charles, 71, named hardest working royal in lockdown despite his own battle with coronavirus","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/VP-COMP-ROYALS.jpg?w=620","content":"STEPPING UP Prince Charles, 71, named hardest working royal in lockdown despite his own battle with coronavirus\n\nPRINCE Charles has today been named the hardest working royal in lockdown.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, 71, managed to wrack up 69 engagements since March 23 - despite isolating for two weeks after being diagnosed with the deadly bug himself.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates\n\n8 Prince Charles visits Middlemoor Fire Station in Exeter on July 22 - today named as one of the hardest working royals Credit: Getty - Pool\n\n8 Kate Middleton and Prince William have started to head out for in person visits Credit: Getty - Pool\n\n8 The Queen even knighted Sir Thomas Moore during the lockdown in a socially distanced ceremony Credit: Getty Images - Getty\n\nThe Duke of Cornwall quarantined in Scotland - losing his sense of taste and smell from the bug - later saying it had made him more determined to \"push and shout and prod\" over issues he was passionate about.\n\nThe future king was then followed by his son Prince William, 38, who conducted 65 engagements with the 94-year-old Queen managing to attend 54 engagements while in lockdown at Windsor.\n\nWhile much of royal work consists of visiting charities and heading to parts of the UK, the members of the Royal Family have embraced Zoom calls to stay in touch.\n\nThe Queen in particular has embraced technology, chatting with four carers and the trust's chief executive Gareth Howells on June 4 from Windsor Castle on a video call.\n\nShe also knighted Sir Thomas Moore in a socially distanced ceremony.\n\nAccording to resume.io's analysis of the Court Circular, which keeps track of the royal's engagements, Prince Philip, 99, has even stepped up during the unprecedented times.\n\nAs the pandemic first unfolded, the retired royal released a statement praising the work of key workers.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh also performed his first royal engagement in three years - thanked for his 67 years of support for The Rifles as he passed his role onto Camilla.\n\nRoyals put in the hard yards during coronavirus It's been an unprecedented few months due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Nora's version of Pachtaoge is designed like an international music video; from the setting to the picturisation and the looks, everything is metaphorical yet classy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTalking about the video, Nora shares, \"My director Rajitdev and I have always wanted to depict emotions and experiences in a more artistic way giving it an international feel. Rajit and I conceptualized the looks based on the emotions and the state of mind.\"\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nNora will sport two different looks, portraying the myriad emotions and stages of romance. Nora explains, \"The looks are very important to the interpretation of the emotions and the journey of the levels of heartbreak. From cloud nine feels, innocence, naivety, to toxicity, dark zones of negativity, anger, disappointment and ego.\"\n\n\"I wanted that the performance should be internal and all in the eyes. Very composed and settle. I've always wanted to get into this zone and I find the song\u2019s lyrics really work well with this kind of a performance,\" she adds.\n\nProducer Bhushan Kumar asserts, \"We have received a lot of appreciation and love for Pachtaoge that released last year. With the female rendition and a new treatment to the tunes and video, we have given the song a completely new touch. Nora and Rajitdev have conceptualized a completely different kind of video and storytelling. We haven't seen such techniques used in a Hindi music video ever before. It\u2019s a new attempt and I hope the audiences like it.\"\n\nDirector Rajit adds, \"From the very beginning, Nora and I had decided to not take the regular route. We had a story line that we wanted to put out, but we wanted to keep it more abstract and metaphorical than just pushing it down people's throats. The entire video is very symbolic. I have to thank Bhushan ji for his unending support and conviction in us and of course, Nora without whom this wouldn't have been possible. From the creative ideas to the performance, she has nailed it all.\"\n\nWritten and composed by Jaani, the music is by B Praak, and Asees has joined the team to sing this female rendition. Asees tells us, \"When I got a call from T-Series for Pachtaoge's female version, I knew there is and will be a lot of expectations. As we know the names attached to it previously are huge like Arijit Singh, B Praak and Jaani. I know that I am in good hands, it is treated well enough and I hope this will join the charts too.\"\n\nCatch up on all the latest entertainment news and gossip here.

Like high schooler Quinn Ackermann, a two-left-footer who does a crash course in dancing in order to get into her first-choice college, \u201cWork It\u201d often feels like it too crammed in hopes of becoming a hit. Directed by Laura Terruso and written by Alison Peck (Alicia Keys is a producer), this fairly routine dance-off outing streams on Netflix starting Aug. 7.\n\nDisney Channel-crafted pop star Sabrina Carpenter leads a cast packed with amiable lovelies, including Liza Koshy as best friend Jas, Jordan Fisher as Quinn\u2019s love interest, and Keiynan Lonsdale as the haughty head of the high school\u2019s championship dance team. Many of these actors have fans and social media followings made up of folks who won\u2019t suffer genre fatigue after years of movies that have done this song-and-dance better.\n\nA straight-A student, Quinn wants to attend her deceased father\u2019s alma mater, Duke University, aka \u201cthe Harvard of the South.\u201d On a campus visit, she lets slightly flighty admissions officer Ms. Ramirez (Michelle Buteau) believe that in addition to all her other extra-curricular successes, she\u2019s on her high school\u2019s championship dance team, the Thunderbirds. She also lets her mom believe her admission is a done deal. It\u2019s not her finest moment but Quinn tries to refashion her lie into a truth by first trying out for the Thunderbirds, led by Julliard, who is attended to by two mean-girl minions. When that doesn\u2019t work, Quinn drags best friend Jas \u2014 an exceptional Thunderbird dancer \u2014 along on what appears a fool\u2019s errand: a new team.\n\nThe classmates they recruit reflect Quinn\u2019s over-achieving research into winning teams as well as the filmmakers\u2019 enthusiastic nods to genre. There\u2019s \u201cflipper\u201d and lanky geek Robby G (Tyler Hutchings); goth rebel Raven (Bianca Asilo); underwhelming soccer player but terrific stepper Chris (Neil Robles); slinger of hot playlists DJ Tapes (Nathaniel Scarlette); and soc-media maven Priya (Indiana Mehta). Fisher steps up as Jake Taylor, the dreamy, wounded (literally as well as figuratively) former dancer and choreographer who declines to mentor these motleys, but can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s destined to become teacher and love interest.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMany a montage later, the multi-racial crew (which never exactly agreed on a name) faces off with the Thunderbirds. Few of the lessons and triumphs of \u201cWork It\u201d will surprise, and some of the missed opportunities disappoint. Why set a movie so specifically in a place \u2014 North Carolina\u2019s Triangle \u2014 and then assiduously avoid anything even vaguely Southern in the movie? And is it really OK to foreground a white protagonist, surround her with friends of color and not write more backstory and texture for these friends? In evading more contemporary concerns (and, yes, they\u2019ve been timely for years), the director and screenwriter stumble some.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some sweet moments in \u201cWork It,\u201d and a winning turn by Carpenter. Among them: a couple of visits to the posh assisted living facility where Quinn volunteers; an even lovelier scene in which a street busking crew of break dancers with disabilities does its thing; a clever remix of a Gloria Estefan hit.\n\nThe dance-offs demand (and often deliver) the kinetic oomph that comes with a precise mix of choreography (courtesy Aakomon Jones of \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d franchise), cinematography (Rogier Stouffers) and editing (Andrew Marcus). Costume designer Georgina Yarhi captures nicely \u201cthe work it, gurllll\u201d brazenness of pink-haired Julian and his Thunderbirds, who flock around the high school halls in flamingo-hued satin sweat suits. And Quinn\u2019s early ensembles (buttoned to the very top, oversized, blue oxford shirt) suggest a young woman who hasn\u2019t yet made friends with her body.\n\nWill dance change Quinn\u2019s wardrobe and her still blossoming soul? \u201cWork It\u201d leaves little room to wonder but a few occasions to sit back and smile at the transformation."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/royal\/1322591\/princess-anne-prince-harry-military-afghanistan-tour-service","domain":"express.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-13 19:42:00","title":"Princess Anne v Prince Harry: Anne met troops in Afghanistan long before Harry served","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.images.express.co.uk\/img\/dynamic\/106\/590x\/Princess-Anne-v-Prince-Harry-1322591.jpg?r=1597347820236","content":"Prince Harry hosts first Invictus Games Foundation Conversation\n\nPrince Harry served in the British Army for 10 years and treasures his military ties to this day.

We still had hope that the producers of the show may have a change of heart about ending their contracts, due to the fact that they are soapville\u2019s favourite villain duo.\n\nFans took to social media this week to express their disappointment at the abrupt cut-offs of the duo by Nkunzi. Many remain hopeful that Godfather will return to the show even though he was shot multiple times. Unlike his brother, Godfather did not have a burial and is expected to be the one that would resurface on the show according to several reliable sources.\n\nNkunzi was accompanied by his wife; MaNgcobo and her daughter to murder the duo but none of them double-checked to see if he\u2019s really dead. In soapville \u2018the deceased rise from the dead\u2019 all the time and the fact that they didn\u2019t bury him like his brother was well thought out.\n\nFans also voiced their disdain, regarding the writer\u2019s predictable storyline and their ghastly repetitive pattern.\n\nThey hire new actors who have the same idea \u2018seeking vengeance against Nkunzi\u2019 a few months later, and as predicted Nkunzi kills them and he keeps winning.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, having one villain in the show is annoying, and every soapie\/telenovela has more than one devious character because it\u2019s exciting and keeps us on the edge of our seats. When the show started five years ago, there were multiple villains who opposed each other and made it thrilling.\n\nThe publicist for the show explained that they dropped the actors because the show is entering a new season, but sources claimed it\u2019s because the duo requested salary hikes.\n\nHowever, with the introduction of Jet Noveka as Captain Yamkela Mpambani, we are hopeful that criminals such as Nkunzi, MaNgcobo and Gabisile will get arrested and rot in jail.\n\nRating: 6\/10 Soapie Stars\n\nMORE SOAPVILLE NEWS FROM IHARARE\n\nLasizwe\u2019s Reality Show Returns\n\nThe River Writer Reveals Big Secret About Lindiwe And Zweli\u2019s Romance That Viewers Didn\u2019t Know\n\n7 Must Watch Shows If You Loved Money Heist\n\nSouth African Actors And Their Partners In Real Life\n\nSkeem Saam:Malebana\u2019s Downfall Is Imminent And It\u2019s Being Caused By Someone He Trusts Most\n\nFollow Us on Google News for Immediate Updates"},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/entertainment\/hindi\/bollywood\/news\/nushrat-bharucha-mourns-actor-sameer-sharmas-death-calls-it-devastating-see-post\/articleshow\/77392887.cms","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-06 11:42:00","title":"Nushrat Bharucha mourns actor Sameer Sharma\u2019s death, calls it \u2018devastating\u2019; see post","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.toiimg.com\/thumb\/msid-77392999,imgsize-568816,width-400,resizemode-4\/77392999.jpg","content":"Bollywood lost another talented actor Sameer Sharma on Wednesday as the actor was found dead at his Malad residence.

The Byrde family has lived in a rough situation since the start of the series, so it only makes sense that showrunner Chris Mundy teased a reckoning of sorts for Wendy and Marty, specifically.\n\nThe Byrdes have bounced between wanting to escape their complicated lives to embracing it, and even finding some sort of normalcy within it. Now the pressure is on, and with the responsibility of running the money-laundering operation for Omar Navarro's cartel squarely on their shoulders, Mundy teased during a pre-recorded panel for Ozark at PaleyFest LA (via Bleeding Cool) what Marty and Wendy will need to wrestle with in the coming episodes.\n\nYou're going to learn what they want their end game to be, and they're going to have to reckon with it a little bit. There's that great scene between Laura [Linney] and Tom [Pelphrey] when they're in the megastore parking lot in the car, and there's a line Miki Johnson wrote, when Wendy says [something] like: 'When you've been running for your life, everything else seems exceedingly dull.' If they're [Marty and Wendy] trying to look to see if there's an out, they've got to figure out if that's what they want, and if so, what's the version of it that they want. Then reckoning with that after so much chaos \u2014 that's going to bubbling under the surface.\n\nAt the end of Season 3, it seemed like Marty and Wendy didn't have many solid options on how to proceed. They could do what Omar Navarro wanted and continue to launder money through their businesses, or they could be killed without a second thought, much like their partner Helen Pierce.\n\nMarty has been offered an out by the FBI, but even then, the options are not great. He'd have to take a plea deal and serve some form of a prison sentence in return for his family's immunity. On top of that, the fact that the best at the FBI can't quite nail Marty to the wall for a crime they know he's committing may cause concern when it comes to whether or not they can effectively protect the family from the cartel in the long (and short) term.\n\nThe third option is to stay the course, which may have proven to be a non-option for Marty and Wendy after witnessing Helen's death. The Ozark couple now fully knows who they're in league with, and how quickly they could be eliminated without a second thought. Does either of them want to live their lives with that possibility always hanging over their heads? Obviously these may be the types of questions Season 4 will wrestle with.\n\nOzark Season 4 is in development at Netflix. Continue to stick with CinemaBlend for more details on the final season, and for the latest news happening in television and movies.\n\nThis poll is no longer available."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.thecut.com\/2020\/08\/love-on-the-spectrum-review-a-dating-show-with-actual-love.html","domain":"thecut.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 18:53:00","title":"A Dating Show With Actual Love?","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/pyxis.nymag.com\/v1\/imgs\/460\/b9a\/82ed9a5fda8c737c55dac6a5ae1a20bc8f-love-on-the-spectrum-cast.rsquare.w400.jpg","content":"Photo: Northern Pictures\n\nAfter decades of The Bachelor and other shows focused on the straight, white person\u2019s experience of love, the reality-dating genre seems to be expanding. A few weeks ago it was with Indian Matchmaking, Netflix\u2019s reality show about the Indian arranged-marriage machine. And last week, it was with Love on the Spectrum, an Australian reality-show-cum-docuseries that follows a group of single adults on the autism spectrum as they explore the dating world.\n\nLove on the Spectrum is built like a typical dating show: We meet the 11 daters, and their friends and families, and follow them in various dating scenarios (speed dating, blind dates, etc.). We spend enough time getting to know each of them so that things don\u2019t feel voyeuristic (which is unusual for the genre) and the tone is more curious than patronizing \u2014 although, it doesn\u2019t always avoid that territory, as Sarah Kurchak, a writer who is on the autism spectrum, noted in her review of the show for Time. Overall, Love on the Spectrum does something that is curiously absent in a genre that is ostensibly about love, which is actually showing it.\n\nTake Ruth and Thomas, who are engaged (and recently got married). They have a ton of chemistry, and a supportive, loving, and very sexy relationship, which they talk about openly. It\u2019s a lot of fun to watch, especially when Thomas \u2014 a bus driver with perfect comedic timing \u2014 plans a surprise waterside picnic for their fourth anniversary, a romantic affair that Ruth calls \u201cvery \u00e0 la The Bachelor.\u201d (She is only occasionally impressed with his romantic gestures: \u201cYou\u2019re a really special girl, Ruth,\u201d he tells her at the end of the date. \u201cWell, you\u2019re a handsome boy,\u201d she responds.) There\u2019s also Chloe, a florist\u2019s assistant who is tentative about dating after a bad relationship, but is sincere about trying again. She has one bad date, but it\u2019s followed by an excellent one picking sunflowers with a young woman named Lotus. It\u2019s exciting to see them both leave totally buoyant, with plans to get together again.\n\nLove on the Spectrum is not a perfect show; it\u2019s often overly sentimental, the participants are mostly straight, white, and middle class, and \u2014 as many critics who are on the spectrum have noted \u2014 it\u2019s clearly made for a neurotypical audience. This is problematic in a lot of ways, many of which I only realized after reading feedback from a neurodiverse audience. For instance, how all of the dates were strictly between autistic people, and how ridiculous the cutesy music is for a dating show about adults. What\u2019s more, the show has been almost routinely reviewed in infantilizing terms (\u201cpure,\u201d \u201csweet,\u201d \u201chonest,\u201d \u201cheartwarming,\u201d etc.). As Charli Clement, one of those critics, wrote: \u201cI\u2019m frustrated, because Love on the Spectrum could have been valuable representation for autistic people [but] this show feels like autistic people being used as inspiration for neurotypical people to reflect on themselves \u2026 The overarching theme, to me, is of othering \u2014 treating us as intrinsically different from neurotypical people.\u201d\n\nI hope these issues are addressed if there\u2019s a second season, but I agree with Kurchak\u2019s observation that this first run of Love on the Spectrum could have \u201cthe potential to open minds, foster genuine empathy for its stars and maybe even spark interest in more autistic stories,\u201d especially given that something as big as Netflix is investing in it. And from a genre perspective, I hadn\u2019t realized until watching this show how infrequently dating shows actually show us love. Romantic love, yes, but also self-love, familial love, and love between friends and communities. It\u2019s strange that the genre is so often devoid of this, but it\u2019s one of the things that make Love on the Spectrum a mostly gratifying watch."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.sportscasting.com\/hulk-hogan-used-to-think-dave-bautista-was-making-fun-of-him-in-promos\/","domain":"sportscasting.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 23:39:00","title":"Hulk Hogan Used to Think Dave Bautista Was Making Fun of Him in Promos","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.sportscasting.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Dave-Bautista-Hulk-Hogan.jpg","content":"We publish independently audited information that meets our strong editorial guidelines . Be aware we may earn a commission if you purchase anything via links on our pages.\n\nDave Bautista and Hulk Hogan have quite a few things in common. Both were multiple-time WWE champions. Both were (and still are) very large human beings. And both have attempted to find success outside the ring as actors.\n\nWhile Hogan may have a more impressive resume as far as professional wrestling is concerned, Bautista has certainly edged the Hulkster in the acting department. While pretty much all of Hogan\u2019s film and television projects were universally panned by critics, Bautista garnered rave reviews for his role of Drax the Destroyer in the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, which are seen by many as some of the best films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nDave Bautista, who dropped a letter and simply went by Batista in WWE, has long said that Hulk Hogan was a big influence on his wrestling promos and that he still sometimes channels the six-time WWE champion in his acting career, even if he doesn\u2019t want to. He says that his promos and interviews sounded so much like Hogan at one point that the Hulkster himself once asked if he was making fun of him.\n\nHulk Hogan and \u2018Macho Man\u2019 Randy Savage were Dave Bautista\u2019s first influences in pro wrestling\n\nRELATED: The Tragic Deaths of \u2018Macho Man\u2019 Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth\n\nWhen Dave Bautista was a teenager in the mid-to-late 1980s, Hulk Hogan and \u201cMacho Man\u201d Randy Savage were the two biggest stars in WWE. On and off as friends on the screen and off, Hogan and Savage were the two biggest draws in the company and just about every wrestler that came after them in the next 10 to 15 years was influenced by at least one of them in one way or another, including Dave Bautista.\n\nIt took longer than most for Bautista to begin his pro wrestling training, not starting until he was close to 30, but once he got to the main roster in WWE in 2002, the same year in which Hulk Hogan won his last WWE Championship, he became an instant star. At 6\u20196\u2033 and 290 pounds of pure muscle, he was a menacing force and quickly became one of the company\u2019s top draws. He honed his craft in Evolution alongside Ric Flair, Triple H, and Randy Orton, which prepared him for a great singles career.\n\nOver the course of his career, Bautista, like Hogan, was a six-time WWE Champion and a two-time Royal Rumble winner. Bautista also held the tag titles on four occasions.\n\nHe was originally scared to get on the microphone\n\nRELATED: Tommy Dreamer Seriously Considered Killing Paul Heyman and Then Himself at WrestleMania 17\n\nWhat hinders a lot of careers in the professional wrestling business is their inability to cut promos. There are so many people that have the look of a pro wrestler or unbelievable in-ring talent but can\u2019t get on the microphone and truly sell themselves to the viewing audience, which is a huge part of the industry if you want to be successful. Like it or not, marks, it\u2019s true.\n\nDave Bautista was originally one of those people. He was obviously an amazing specimen and played the part of an unstoppable monster very well. But it took a little while for him to get used to the promo part of things, which is why it was so helpful to be with Ric Flair and Triple H early in his career. The same could be said for Randy Orton. Both learned from two of the best the business has ever seen and both got so much better as their careers progressed.\n\nBut every so often, Bautista found himself going back to Hulk Hogan-type promos, you know, that high-octane style that he was never truly comfortable with but always channeled when he was nervous. One was so spot on that Hogan actually thought Bautista was making fun of him.\n\nHulk Hogan thought Dave Bautista was making fun of him in promos\n\n(L-R) Dave Bautista; Hulk Hogan | Mary Clavering\/Young Hollywood\/Getty Images; Jerod Harris\/Getty Images\n\nRELATED: WWE Hall of Famer Mark Henry Once Met a \u2018Disrespectful\u2019 Michael Jordan and Things Nearly Didn\u2019t End Well For No. 23\n\nIn an interview with Sports Illustrated to promote his latest acting project, an episode of HBO\u2019s Room 104, in which he plays a former pro wrestler dealing with brain damage and memory loss, Dave Bautista explained how Hulk Hogan influenced his promos and how he still sometimes goes back to that in his acting career.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of my wrestling career, I was so terrified to be on the microphone, so I\u2019d subconsciously channel a bit of Hulk Hogan and the Macho Man. Even when filming Room 104, and it isn\u2019t intentional, that\u2019s who I channel. That is my first childhood connection to professional wrestling. \u201cI remember I did this interview years ago where it came across like I was doing this impersonation of Hulk Hogan. It wasn\u2019t my intent but that\u2019s the way it came off, and I remember saying, \u2018This just isn\u2019t me. I\u2019m just not that guy.\u2019 I later saw Hogan at a show and he asked if I was making fun of him. I said no, I didn\u2019t mean that at all. That\u2019s just my first connection to professional wrestling. They did promos a certain way, and it still impacts my work.\u201d Dave Bautista\n\nDave Bautista was set to join Hulk Hogan in the WWE Hall of Fame this year but the ceremony, which was to be held over WrestleMania weekend, was canceled.

He would be 91 today, and nearly 33 years have passed since he died, yet his golden voice is still loved \u2014 and possibly, due to streaming on mobile phones, heard more than ever before.\n\nKishore Kumar\u2019s voice is bewitching. He began with a nasal twang, singing Marne Ki Duayen (Ziddi, 1948) as a teenager in his idol KL Saigal\u2019s style; he came to his own in the 1950s, with possibly the most youthful version of his voice, as in Jeevan Ke Safar Mein Raahi (Munimji, 1955) or Hum Hain Rahi Pyar Ke (Nau Do Gyarah, 1950) or Ik Ladki Bheegi Bhaagi Si (Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, 1958).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe acquired a deep base as he aged \u2014 or perhaps began to use it more when he started singing for actors like Amitabh Bachchan, Rajesh Khanna, Shatrughan Sinha, Shashi Kapoor and Sunil Dutt in the 1970s. Yet, he could always go back to the softest version of his voice, even in his late 50s \u2014 sample Tanha Mein Akela from Sachche Ka Bolbala, released in 1989, two years after he died at age 58.\n\nAlso read: Ayushmann Khurrana: I am a huge fan of Kishore Kumar\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the heart\n\nJust what is it about Kishore Kumar\u2019s voice that makes it \u2014 to his fans at least \u2014 the most powerful, most touching voice that was featured in Hindi movies? The answer is simple: His is the voice of youth; youth relate with it, older people want to relate with it.\n\nHe sang without gimmickry \u2014 no complex taans or murkis or harkats \u2014 just singing from the heart, each word sang with clarity, voice matched with the weight of the word. It expressed sadness with deep bass, rather than high-pitched singing, which tends to turn the male voice effeminate, weepy. His voice conveyed pathos without losing masculinity.\n\nIt was forever youthful. This is how Kishore Kumar ruled, and rules.\n\nJaved Akhtar, both a friend and fan of Kishore Kumar, says that each time he sang with another singer, it was Kishore\u2019s voice that stood out \u2014 it\u2019s a typical fan\u2019s comment and is debatable. But what can\u2019t be debated with are numbers, which suggest that Kishore Kumar is the most popular singer among the golden generation of the Hindi film singers. When people used to buy cassettes and CDs of songs, HMV used to sell more Kishore Kumar music than that of the next three Hindi film playback legends (Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi, Asha Bhosle) combined!\n\nIf you now go by downloads on HMV\u2019s website, or number of YouTube views, you\u2019d find that Kishore\u2019s songs continue to dominate.\n\nTwin songs\n\nWhat also can\u2019t be debated is that when Kishore and another singer sang the same song, it was Kishore\u2019s version that became more successful. There are countless such examples, beginning in the 1950s with Qusoor Aapka Huzoor Aapka (Bahar, 1951; also sung by Shamshad Begum); Jeevan Ke Safar Mein Rahi (Munimji, 1955; also sung by Lata); Dil Dil Se Milakar Dekho (Mem Sahib, 1956; also sung by Asha Bhosle); Eena Meena Dika (Aasha, 1957; also sung by Asha Bhosle).\n\nThere were many such songs in the 1960s too \u2014 Chhoti Si Yeh Duniya (Rangoli, 1962; also sung by Lata); Ajnabi Tum Jaane Pehchaane Se (Hum Sab Ustad Hain, 1965; also sung by Lata); Tum Bin Jaun Kahan (Pyar Ka Mausam, 1969; also sung by Rafi).\n\nKishore Kumar\u2019s versions of these songs became more popular than the other versions.\n\nIn such songs of the 1970s, too, Kishore\u2019s version was and remains more popular. The most notable of these was Mere Naina Sawan Bhadon (Mehbooba, 1976; also sung by Lata), a difficult, soulful composition based on raga Shivranjani. For an untrained singer to outdo Lata is simply amazing \u2014 it also underscored that Kishore Kumar took his singing very, very seriously, despite his loony behaviour. For him, the raga was just a name \u2014 he got RD Burman to change the recording date so that Lata\u2019s version was recorded first; he then took a copy of Lata\u2019s song and, note by note, dissected it, rehearsed it for at least a week, and sang it perfectly \u2014 without bothering to learn about the raga or its notation.\n\nKishore\n\nLata Mangeshkar\n\nLata\u2019s version is perfect, too, but Kishore\u2019s has a great infusion of feeling, heart in it. You could say this also about two other such songs Kishore and Lata sang in the 1970s \u2014 Khilte Hain Gul Yahan (Sharmilee, 1971) and Rimjhim Girey Sawan (Manzil, 1979).\n\nKishore\n\nLata Mangeshkar\n\nA number from the 1980s that must be mentioned is Humein Tumse Pyar Kitna (Kudrat, 1981) \u2014 the other singer is the peerless Parveen Sultana, the great classical singer who effortlessly takes her voice to an impossibly high pitch. The song, based on Raag Bhairavi, is a great example of Kishore making a deeper mark with his simple and heart-touching rendition, even when paired with a great classical singer like Sultana. With him, the depth of the lyrics and the singing, straight from the heart, never fail.\n\nKishore\n\nParveen Sultana\n\nThere\u2019s a song that Kishore sang that was later rendered by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan \u2014 Main Aur Meri Awargi, which Kishore sang for Duniya (1984).

The American Song Contest will welcome musical artists and bands from each of the 50 states and across every musical genre, to perform all original songs on the live televised event. The announcement was made today by The American Song Contest rights owners and producers Anders Lenhoff, Christer Bj\u00f6rkman, Ola Melzig and Peter Settman, and Mr. Silverman.\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest is one of the biggest televised events in the world, with more than 200MM people tuning in annually, a larger audience than the Super Bowl in the United States. During the Grand Finale, audience shares in 40 markets routinely double primetime viewership on participating networks, and among 15 \u2013 34 year old audiences, the viewership is quadrupled. With contestants representing their home country and creating record-breaking national interest, the Eurovision Song Contest is a cultural event on a scale in Europe rivaled only by the World Cup and the Olympics, and has launched the careers of a wide variety of artists, including previous winners Celine Dion and Abba, as well as Julio Iglesias and numerous others. The U.S. music industry has long recognized the power of the event with Justin Timberlake and Madonna breaking new music on the show in recent years. The day after Justin Timberlake debuted \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling!\u201d on the Eurovision Song Contest, the single hit #1 on the music charts.\n\nThe American Song Contest producer Mr. Lenhoff, on behalf of his producing partners Messrs. Bj\u00f6rkman, Melzig and Settman, said: \u201c Imagine if music was an Olympic sport and artists from all over the world came together to compete for the gold. That\u2019s the Eurovision Song Contest. The American version will be different than anything seen before on U.S. television, marrying the fanfare and excitement of March Madness and the NFL playoffs with the artistry and beauty of world-class performances. The American Song Contest is a competition that happens to be televised, rather than a contest created to make a television show. And it\u2019s open to all singers with a song, whether they are amateur artists or already signed to a major record label. No one is excluded from the competition.\u201d\n\nSaid Mr. Silverman: \u201c For more than 20 years, I\u2019ve tried to bring the Eurovision Song Contest to the United States because it is the greatest and most successful format yet to be adapted. Before I found Who Wants To Be A Millionaire or there was a Pop Idol, Eurovision was dominating the ratings and charts. Put simply, there is nothing else like it on television. The sheer spectacle is amazing. It is a pure celebration of the best in music and the best of what music can be, produced by the world\u2019s elite artisans in all fields of production. The Eurovision Song Contest has shown that it can unite different countries and artists for a few nights every year to focus on their mutual love and respect for music. Bringing The American Song Contest and the Eurovision brand to the U.S. is an incredibly ambitious project, but one worth doing, since we think these inherent values are intrinsic to uniting a fractional America through its greatest export and global impact \u2026 culture!!!\u201d\n\nAs a lead up to the live televised competition, Propagate Content and The American Song Contest producing team will create The American Song Contest Academy, a group consisting of music professionals based in the U.S. that represent all genres and backgrounds. These members will create juries of artists and music industry notables who, along with the regional audiences, will select top talent from all 50 states to compete. These representatives of each state can be either solo artists, duos or bands with up to 6 members.\n\nThe format, as it is currently conceived, will position the artists head to head against other states\u2019 representatives in a series of 5-10 televised Qualifier Competitions, leading to Semi-Finals and the ultimate primetime Grand Finale March Madness style.\n\nMartin \u00d6sterdahl, Executive Supervisor, Eurovision Song Contest: \u201c The Eurovision Song Contest\u2019s unique legacy dates back sixty five years and its worldwide popularity is still rising. It\u2019s time for America to experience this spectacle, through its sister competition, the American Song Contest. Love of music is universal and celebration of music in different genres and styles can transcend boundaries and unite people. We are excited to have found the right partners to offer another series that our fans across the globe can fall in love with and to share this unique competition with the American people.\u201d\n\nFurther details will be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nThe American Song Contest Team\n\nWith over 60 years of legacy, hundreds of hours of live television and over 1,500 songs from more than 50 countries, the Eurovision Song Contest is the world's biggest live music event uniting nearly 200 million people every May.\n\nThe force behind The American Song Contest and EBU\u2019s brand entr\u00e9e into America includes some of the top global minds in entertainment, music and television. Anders Lenhoff, one of Europe\u2019s top creative producers, is joined by Peter Settman, a leading television entrepreneur and producer, Ola Melzig, a renowned television and mega-event producer, and Christer Bj\u00f6rkman, who famously performed on the Eurovision Song Contest and later became one of its longest-running producers. The team holds the long-term license to run the competition in the United States.\n\nCrucial to the team in the U.S. is Ben Silverman, the prolific producer and television executive who propelled the American version of The Office to global status as well as creating The Biggest Loser, finding and packaging Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, Ugly Betty, Jane The Virgin and many more global hits. His company with partner Howard Owens, Propagate Content, has gained a reputation as a transformative content creator and developer for television, film and podcasts.\n\nAbout Propagate Content:\n\nhttps:\/\/propagatecontent.com\/\n\nAbout European Broadcasting Union (EBU):\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ebu.ch\/home\n\nAbout the Eurovision Song Contest:\n\nhttps:\/\/eurovision.tv\/\n\nThe American Song Contest Executive Producers Bios:\n\nPETER SETTMAN IS A LEADING TV ENTREPRENEUR AND PRODUCER IN SCANDINAVIA.\n\nHe founded and ran Baluba, which grew into the largest independent production company in the region before Settman sold it in 2009.

His true legacy began in 2002 when he was appointed Contest Producer and Creative Director for Melodifestivalen, the Swedish selection show for the Eurovision Song Contest. At the time, Melodifestivalen was a crumbling format in steep decline but, with Christer Bj\u00f6rkman at the helm, it quickly turned into one of the biggest TV success stories in the world. It has been, by far, the biggest entertainment show in Scandinavia for almost two decades, with ratings of up to 40% of the population and a share of 85% and beyond for the Grand Finale every year. During Bj\u00f6rkman\u2019s reign, Sweden has won the Eurovision Song Contest twice, making it the second most successful competing country in history with six victories in total. Christer Bj\u00f6rkman is also the most experienced Eurovision Contest Producer ever with five shows and is a consultant to broadcasters all over Europe.

We may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via links.\n\nThere are a lot of things Anakin Skywalker is remembered for in the Star Wars saga, such as his love of podracing, being a hero of the Clone Wars, turning to the dark side and becoming a terrifying cyborg. But among Anakin\u2019s more cringeworthy moments during the Prequel Trilogy was in Attack of the Clones, when he told Padme Amidala that he didn\u2019t like sand because it\u2019s \u201ccoarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.\u201d\n\nGiven Anakin Skywalker\u2019s rough childhood on Tatooine, it\u2019s understandable why he\u2019d have negative feelings about sand, but nevertheless, that line has received a lot of ridicule in the nearly two decades since Attack of the Clones came out. Now a new Star Wars story has poked fun at that line by declaring that his son, Luke Skywalker, is a huge fan of sand\u2026 well, under the right circumstances.\n\nMarvel\u2019s current Star Wars ongoing comic book series follows Luke Skywalker in the time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi as he investigates a vision he experienced of a mysterious woman catching the lightsaber he lost in his duel against Darth Vader on Cloud City. While Luke has already decided he doesn\u2019t want his father\u2019s old lightsaber back, his journey to find that woman takes him to the planet Serelia in the latest issue. Alas, when Luke finds the woman, she runs away from him, leading into an intense water chase and Luke being tossed into the waves.\n\nUpon being rescued by R2-D2, Luke Skywalker says the following when making it back to shore (via Digital Spy):\n\nWhoa. Good old sand. I ever tell you how much I love sand.\n\nThere you have it, folks. Luke Skywalker lived on Tatooine approximately twice as long as his father did, but even he can find a reason to like sand. Granted, that was after almost drowning, so maybe under normal circumstances, Luke also isn\u2019t that fond of it. Oh well, at least for Star Wars fans, we have yet another amusing mockery of Anakin Skywalker\u2019s infamous sand line.\n\nLuke eventually tracks down the woman who eluded him later on in Star Wars #5, learning that her name is Verla and that while she\u2019s not a Jedi, she is Force-sensitive. Luke then learns about Order 66 and the Inquisitorius, i.e. how any Jedi, or anyone thought to be a Jedi, is to be killed on sight. That\u2019s why Verla ran away from Luke; she thought he was hunting her for the Empire.\n\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nIt initially seems like Luke and Verla are on good terms, but before Luke can inquire with her about his vision of her holding his old lightsaber, Verla discovers Luke is Darth Vader\u2019s son, and the issue ends with her trying to drown him. You\u2019ll have to wait until Star Wars #6 comes out next month to learn how Luke gets out of this jam, though obviously he survives since he needs to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt\u2019s clutches on Tatooine, the planet covered in sand.

Rowling\u2019s famed fantasy book series is set to roll off HBO Max as of Aug. 25, after WarnerMedia had carved out a three-month window for the popular franchise following its launch.\n\nIn 2016, NBCU inked a deal with Warner Bros. locking up TV and digital rights to the Potter movies (including \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d) from 2018-2025 that also incorporated content for Universal theme parks.\n\n\u201cThe Harry Potter franchise is beloved by people of all ages and represents the caliber of quality entertainment customers can expect to find on Peacock,\u201d said Frances Manfredi, Peacock\u2019s president of content acquisition and strategy, in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve built a world-class collection of iconic movies and shows, and we will continue to expand the film library with treasured titles from NBCUniversal and beyond that will surprise and delight Peacock customers time and time again.\u201d\n\nStarting in October, Peacock customers will be able to stream \u201cHarry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone\u201d (2001), \u201cHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\u201d (2002), \u201cHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\u201d (2004), \u201cHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\u201d (2005), \u201cHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\u201d (2007), \u201cHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\u201d (2009) and \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u201d parts 1 (2010) and 2 (2011).\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe eight films, released between 2001 and 2011, rank as the third highest-grossing movie franchises in history with a worldwide haul of $7.7 billion (behind Disney\u2019s Marvel and Star Wars).\n\nPeacock launched nationwide in the U.S. on July 15 \u2014 but a number of the big movies on the streaming service rolled off the service in a matter of days or weeks. Those titles, which seemingly aimed at attracting users to the fledgling streamer, included the original 2009 \u201cFast & Furious\u201d and comedy \u201cEvan Almighty,\u201d \u201cShrek\u201d; the trio of Universal\u2019s \u201cJurassic Park\u201d movies and all three of Warner Bros.\u2019s \u201cMatrix\u201d movies.\n\nAs part of Comcast\u2019s second-quarter 2020 earnings announcement last week, the company touted that Peacock landed 10 million signups since it debuted in April for Comcast Xfinity and Flex customers and on July 15 nationally.

If you're looking for the type of energy you can expect from The Devil All the Time film adaptation, you might turn to Jeff Baker's review of the novel in The Oregonian. Baker writes that the story, \"Reads as if the love child of [Flannery] O'Connor and [William] Faulkner was captured by Cormac McCarthy, kept in a cage out back and forced to consume nothing but onion rings, Oxycontin and Terrence Malick's Badlands.\" If you're looking for the shorthand of that sentence, it says The Devil All the Time is exquisitely and existentially bleak.

Except, there\u2019s a twist.\n\nAfter Hamilton\u2019s wild success on Disney+, musicals are looking to become big business for streaming giants. In fact, we already learned Disney is planning to adapt another hit Broadway musical with Once On This Island, and now Netflix is hopping into the game by adapting the Broadway musical Diana, based on Princess Diana\u2019s life, per The BBC. The twist? Netflix will actually release the filmed version before the musical hits the Broadway stage.\n\nThe plan is to film the musical on stage in New York without a live audience. While we don\u2019t know when that will take place or when Netflix plans to release the musical on the streaming site, we do know that Diana is scheduled to hit Broadway on May 25, 2021. Broadway has closed its doors to the public through 2020 as the pandemic surges in certain locations.\n\nSo it makes sense a move like this might be made, though this is truly a first. A Broadway musical has never been released in a movie theater or on TV before first appearing on a stage. In the past, the fear was that if a Broadway show came to homes too soon, there wouldn\u2019t be any motivation to go see the production live. However, with Hamilton\u2019s success and the strange times we live in, perceptions and motivations may be changing.\n\nThe rush to streaming has also caused never-before-seen changes in how and when people see movies, which has only been exacerbated by current events. First, back in April, Universal made the tough choice to release Trolls World Tour back in April direct to VOD. More recently, due to current events, Warner Bros. made the unprecedented announcement that Tenet, after seeing several delays, would release internationally before hitting US theaters. This was also a surprise, considering Tenet was supposed to be a huge blockbuster that brought people back to theaters in the US. Tenet is set to release in the US on September 3.\n\nIn another big twist, Disney announced this month that Mulan, one of the studio's greatly anticipated live-action remakes, would skip a theatrical release and go straight to the streaming platform Disney+. On top of that, Disney is busy experimenting with what could be a new model and threw another curveball, noting Disney+ would charge an additional $30 for subscribers. only to see it.\n\nNetflix, for its part, has long changed the way audiences have consumed content. From its humble beginnings as a DVD rental delivery service to its now giant streaming website, Netflix seems to have a knack for changing how the game is played. Diana coming to its streaming service first before hitting Broadway looks to be just another chapter in the ever-evolving market."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.news18.com\/news\/movies\/films-can-give-birth-to-thoughts-pankaj-tripathi-on-playing-progressive-father-in-gunjan-saxena-2771665.html","domain":"news18.com","published_date":"2020-08-09 12:24:00","title":"Films Can Give Birth to Thoughts: Pankaj Tripathi on Playing Progressive Father in 'Gunjan Saxena'","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.news18.com\/ibnlive\/uploads\/2020\/08\/1596975800_gunjan-saxena-still.jpg?impolicy=website&width=640&height=480","content":"Actor Pankaj Tripathi remembers the phone calls from his friends after they saw \"Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl\". As fathers to daughters, they were moved by the bond he shared with Janhvi Kapoor's Gunjan in the movie.\n\nTripathi, a versatile performer who has played characters of all shades, loved playing Anup Saxena, a man who doesn't believe that aspirations should be gendered.\n\n\"It's a very important role in my career because the way I am or want to be as a father, the film represents that. 'Mujhe gunda, mawali bana dete hai' (I often get villainous roles). But playing Anup Saxena was close to what I am in real life with my daughter or aspire to be. I want the world to have more such fathers,\" he told PTI in a Zoom interview.\n\n\"I remember when people who know me watched the film, they called me and told me, 'Yaar, after seeing your film, I went home and hugged my daughter'. This solves my purpose,\" Tripathi added.\n\nThe 43-year-old actor maybe more famous for his negative turns in movies such as \"Gangs of Wasseypur\", \"Gurgaon\" and web series like \"Mirzapur\", but he has also mastered the art of playing progressively uncomplicated men like Indian Railways employee Sadhya ji in \"Masaan\", a math teacher in \"Nil Battey Sannata\", and a doting father in \"Bareilly Ki Barfi\" and now in \"Gunjan Saxena\".\n\nTripathi believes films can help make people aware about a good idea.\n\n\"I know that films don't change people but films can put a thought in one's mind and if you have that thought then maybe you will change a little. It is important to have that thought. I hope I have managed that in the film,\" he added.\n\nHis co-star Janhvi shared that her father, producer Boney Kapoor, messaged Tripathi after watching the film.\n\n\"Boney ji sent me a message late in the night. He was very emotional after watching the film. He wrote, 'You are a better father to Janhvi than me'. It touched me,\" Tripathi said recalling the conversation between the real and reel fathers.\n\nHis dynamic with Janhvi's Gunjan in the upcoming movie runs parallel to her aspiration to become a pilot, a dream that her father fuels despite opposition from his wife and son, who believe it to be job unfit for women.\n\nThe film is based on the life of Gunjan Saxena, then a flying officer, who became the first woman combat aviator to fly into a war zone during the 1999 Kargil War.\n\nTripathi credits Janhvi, 23, for putting in the hard work to become familiar with him and his family.\n\n\"She would call me 'Sir, where are you? When do you finish shooting? Should I come?' I would say, 'Haan, aa jao. Poochhna kya?' (Sure, why the formality?) She would be there eating with my family by the time I reached home. She spent five-six days and lived like a family member with my wife and daughter,\" the actor said.\n\nTripathi said as professional actors they could have directly met on the set in Lucknow but with Janhvi going an extra mile to know him before the shoot changed their equation, making their scenes feel more natural.\n\nJanhvi said she was just happy to learn from Tripathi.\n\n\"Gunjan ji looks up to her father and idolises him, this is how I idolise Pankaj ji. Even on the sets, I would watch him perform and seek his guidance. Basically, we had a similar relationship off camera,\" she added.\n\nTripathi said he had become attached to Janhvi while working on the film, and if they do a film in future, he will have to reboot completely.\n\nThe actor said he trusted director Sharan Sharma a lot while working on the film, including in a crucial scene, the only one in the entire film when father and daughter have a conflict.\n\n\"I trusted Sharan a lot. I am a director's actor. I tell every director 'If something is not working, you have to tell me. Don't think that I will mind it. I will change if you don't like something in my performance'. I am glad the scene has been liked so much. I did not prepare for it. We did a rough take and then completed the shot,\" he added.\n\nAlso starring Ayesha Raza Mishra, Vineet Kumar Singh, Manav Vij and Angad Bedi, \"Gunjan Saxena\" will start streaming on Netflix from August 12."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.comingsoon.net\/movies\/news\/1145446-zack-snyder-swaps-chris-delia-with-tig-notaro-for-army-of-the-dead","domain":"comingsoon.net","published_date":"2020-08-14 19:31:48","title":"Zack Snyder Swaps Chris D\u2019Elia with Tig Notaro for Army of the Dead","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.comingsoon.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/3\/2020\/08\/GettyImages-1204531556.jpg?w=800","content":"Following a wave of sexual harassment allegations leveled at the comedian, Zack Snyder is swapping out Chris D\u2019Elia (You) from the ensemble roster of Army of the Dead with fellow comedian\/actress Tig Notaro (Instant Family), according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nRELATED: Zack Snyder\u2019s Army of the Dead Wraps Filming!\n\nThough filming initially wrapped on the project last October, sources report that a round of reshoots are currently planned solely to incorporate Notaro and her character into the heart of the story but that due to the rest of its stars being busy with other projects and current pandemic restrictions on productions, her interactions with co-stars will mostly be done with a combination of shooting scenes opposite a stand-in, green screen and CG technology.\n\n\u201cThe movie takes place in Las Vegas,\u201d Snyder previously said. \u201cA zombie plague hits Vegas, and they\u2019re able to contain the virus to the city \u2013 they build a wall out of shipping containers.

Before joining Vox in 2016, they were a staff reporter at the Daily Dot. A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they\u2019re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.\n\nIn the second episode of Lovecraft Country, HBO\u2019s engrossing new pulp horror series, one character, George (Courtney B. Vance), keeps thinking about a book.\n\nThe book in question is the 1903 horror fantasy The House on the Borderland, and its plot is eerily similar to George\u2019s present situation: He\u2019s a Black man trapped in a strange mansion along with his friends, presented with various temptations and hallucinogenic visions \u2014 including dancing with a woman he knows to be a figment of his imagination. \u201cDo the lovers stay together at the end?\u201d his ghostly date asks of the story. \u201cYes,\u201d he responds \u2014 but only because the giant house they\u2019re in collapses.\n\nThere\u2019s an obvious metaphor in the scene about the work Lovecraft Country is trying to do. The show\u2019s story closely follows Matt Ruff\u2019s 2016 novel of the same name, about a Black community in Chicago that becomes entangled with an ominous occult society, all while fighting Jim Crow racism on a scale both everyday and cosmic. Ruff\u2019s novel was an attempt to grapple with the legacy of H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s writing, which is both towering in its influence and teeming with racism. As crafted by showrunner Misha Green, the story, therefore, is both a homage and a repudiation.\n\nVox Rating: 3.5 out of 5\n\nIt\u2019s a homage in that it gleefully plays with many of the horror tropes its namesake popularized: terrifying otherworldly monsters, esoteric cults, scary American mansions housing obscure spellbooks and dark secrets.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a repudiation in that it also attempts to wrestle with those tropes and perhaps free them from Lovecraft\u2019s territorial grasp as a loud, vehement, unabashed white supremacist.\n\nIt\u2019s helpful to think of Lovecraft Country, then, as akin to a game of Jenga: Its aim isn\u2019t to collapse the house that genre built, but rather to slide a new layer of storytelling on top of century-old bones to find out if the entire structure can still hold. For the most part, it holds very well.\n\nLovecraft Country\u2019s characters are mythological tricksters. They have to be.\n\nTic waits for a ride he know won\u2019t be coming for him. HBO\n\nOur story opens as a troubled Korean war veteran named Atticus, a.k.a. Tic (Jonathan Majors), searches for his father Montrose (Michael K. Williams). Though there\u2019s no love lost between Tic and his dad, after Montrose goes missing in the New England wilds that his family calls \u201cLovecraft country,\u201d Atticus, his uncle George (Vance) and his pal Letitia (Jurnee Smollett) set out on a road trip to search for him. But their plans quickly spiral, and soon they\u2019re confronting monsters in America\u2019s backwoods and small towns. Only some of those monsters are inhuman.\n\nOn another TV show, this basic plot might last for a full season, culminating in the group locating Montrose and a dramatic confrontation in a giant creepy mansion. But Lovecraft Country gives you the feeling it\u2019s got no time to waste on such dramatics, so instead the story unfolds very rapidly, largely dealing with the aftermath of that road trip.\n\nThe group\u2019s brush with a white supremacist cult has left them entangled in the vague plots of a young witch, Christina (Abbey Lee, whose vibe is very Rory Gilmore meets The Craft), and her creepy pal William (Jordan Patrick Smith, whose vibe is very Draco Malfoy meets Skarsg\u00e5rd). Soon, George\u2019s wife Hippolyta (Aunjanue Ellis), her daughter Diana (Jada Harris), and Lettie\u2019s sister Ruby (Wunmi Mosaku) are all also becoming ensnared in the labyrinthine plots of the cult and its enemies \u2014 all while having to deal with much bigger immediate threats like racist neighbors, job discrimination, and violent cops.\n\nLovecraft Country upfronts the realities of Jim Crow racism for its families. George actually edits a fictional version of a Green Book guide for Black travelers which Hippolyta hopes to join him in writing for one day, and they argue about how to tour the country safely while avoiding sundown towns and racist police. The series reminds us again and again that Black Americans have always had to rely on each other for information, help, and protection in a world that was built to ostracize them.\n\nThese are depictions usually reserved for the segregated South in \u201950s- and \u201960s-era storytelling; though Lovecraft Country is set within that period, most of it takes place in Chicago and Massachusetts, where racist division was very much alive and well but much harder to navigate because it was so often unseen. It\u2019s rare to see the North\u2019s racism get such a harsh excavation, but it\u2019s an effective use of literal racism as horror. Without the South\u2019s more overt legalized racism, the story\u2019s Black characters have to constantly feel their way through every situation: Any town could be a sundown town, any cop could be a white supremacist, and situations that feel stable could become unstable at any moment. It all adds to Lovecraft Country\u2019s permeating layer of dread.\n\nBecause Lovecraft Country is airing at a moment when its themes of police brutality and systemic injustice are unfortunately more relevant than they\u2019ve been in years, the hype that has built up around it is the type usually reserved for prestige TV. But while its aims are similar to those of Watchmen, Lovecraft Country is deliberately pulpy. Through the five episodes that HBO has made available for review, the show gambols between various pulp genres like supernatural fantasy \u00e0 la Lovecraft and Weird Tales, comic books with superpowered heroes and villains, and high tomb-raiding antics out of Edwardian adventure series (think Allan Quatermain or Prisoner of Zenda). Lovecraft Country isn\u2019t just coming for Lovecraft; rather, it\u2019s reclaiming a century of pop literature for Black geeks who never got to be the heroes of those narratives.\n\nThe show is also repudiating the pompous dramatics of its silly cult full of white people trying to something something pure bloodlines, something something existential cosmic terror.\n\nLovecraft, however, remains the central topic of deconstruction. If Lovecraft is obsessed with the omnipresent specters of other races, foreign tongues, and madness, then Lovecraft Country shifts those fears into the point of view of mid-century Black America. Lovecraft\u2019s constant dread of The Other becomes the pervasive threat of whiteness. His terrifying, impenetrable languages become the changing rules and constant hurdles of systemic racism. The strain of avoiding madness becomes the stress of trusting one\u2019s own judgment and experience when reality bends to fit the preferred narrative of white society.\n\nPerhaps most crucially, the characters themselves shift, too. Lovecraft\u2019s heroes were always men, usually erudite and educated, who nevertheless stood in terror of confronting the vast cosmic indifference of the universe and realizing they weren\u2019t at the center of it. The plots of his stories always revolved around their unfolding of the mysteries they found themselves in, and often being driven mad because of it.\n\nNone of these concerns apply to our heroes. As Black men and women, they\u2019re under no illusion that the universe was built for them. They\u2019re much more concerned with basic survival. But their self-awareness also gives them an edge that few of Lovecraft\u2019s characters traditionally possess: They know what kind of story they\u2019re in.\n\nLovecraft Country\u2019s protagonists instantly adapt to the bizarre nature of the supernatural elements around them. Atticus and George are huge fans of weird fiction and horror; they know exactly who and what Lovecraft is and what his stories are about. George\u2019s daughter Diana likewise is a budding superhero artist and writer of comic book sci-fi. They and their families, however reluctantly, know that to survive tropes, you have to subvert them. That allows them to one-up and outwit the dangers that lie in wait for them, whether those dangers come in the form of racist cults, Indiana Jones-style booby traps, or lying cops. They\u2019re tricksters in the truest mythological sense: Their ability to turn the villains\u2019 traps against those villains reveals the traps\u2019 shaky construction.\n\nLovecraft Country isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s perfectly enjoyable\n\nThe show finds its strongest moments when it layers realism atop metaphorical racism to induce a mounting, increasingly surreal two-fold horror. It\u2019s weaker in terms of connecting those moments back to its overarching plot. But that weakness also feels intentional and refreshing \u2014 as if the show is also repudiating the pompous dramatics of its silly cult full of white people trying to something something pure bloodlines, something something sorcery, something something existential cosmic terror.\n\nInstead, Lovecraft Country allows itself to be more interested in small stuff, like filming an entire scene mostly underwater because it\u2019s really cool, or devoting an entire episode to routing the racists next door because that\u2019s vital to the main characters\u2019 everyday realities. It\u2019s not quite a pastiche or an anthology show, but it has a similar irreverence for the sanctity of an epic drama. And that irreverence is especially valuable in the way it helps the show present in-your-face, omnipresent racism as part of the real landscape of America.\n\nLovecraft Country boasts clever, engaging storytelling, but it has less to do with the genres it\u2019s playing with than one might hope. There are literal references galore to the weird fiction writers Lovecraft drew inspiration from and influenced in turn \u2014 but although I recognize there\u2019s still plenty of room for supernatural expansion in future episodes, I found myself wishing the vision of the story was a bit broader. One of the biggest absurdities of Lovecraft is that for all he stood in dread of cosmic terror, the most frightening thing he could imagine emanating from that cosmos was basically a really big squid. By the same token, it\u2019s more than a little disappointing that Lovecraft Country \u2014 at least so far \u2014 hasn\u2019t done more to expand its imagination about what lurks in the beyond.\n\nIn its early going, the story remains very faithful to Ruff\u2019s novel, and the encroaching horrors scale up nicely from episode to episode. But the show seems wary of getting too lost in its fantasies, at the risk of downplaying the fact that everyday life for its characters is rarely a daydream.\n\nParticularly odd is Lovecraft Country\u2019s squick about sex and sexuality, which is almost always shown as brutal and unpleasant, if not outright rape, a form of rough power play and violence. On a show where families and community are generally shown as the only safe and intimate harbor, however troubled, it\u2019s a discordant note.\n\nFor the most part, however, Lovecraft Country stays honest and engrossing, the kind of show you trust to iron out its own kinks. And it\u2019s more important, ultimately, that the show never lets its indulgence in fantasy overbalance its keen look at racism in America. The show shrewdly leans into a blunt emphasis on the latter that might have felt over-the-top and hamfisted a decade ago.\n\nNo matter what, Lovecraft Country\u2019s opening episodes provide an overdue, much-needed perspective shift \u2014 a constant reminder that America was always Lovecraft\u2019s country, and many of its citizens are just trying to survive it.\n\nLovecraft Country debuts Sunday, August 16, at 9 pm on HBO.\n\nWill you become our 20,000th supporter?

The trailer comes with a brief synopsis of the show that says: \u201cMother was programmed to protect everyone after Earth had been destroyed. When the big bad wolf shows up, she is the one we must trust.\u201d\n\nIt shows an android (Amanda Collin) raising children on another planet and a military-like team suddenly disturbing their seemingly peaceful existence. As you watch the trailer, though, you\u2019ll get glimpses of \u201cMother\u201d that calls her purpose and her nature into question. She\u2019s either humanity\u2019s savior or she might be more like the robot in Netflix\u2019s I Am Mother.\n\nThe series will be available for streaming on HBO Max, which is still only limited to users in the US, starting on September 3rd."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.irishcentral.com\/culture\/entertainment\/eurovison-song-contest-coming-to-america","domain":"irishcentral.com","published_date":"2020-08-09 15:54:17","title":"A version of the Eurovison Song Contest is coming to America","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.irishcentral.com\/assets\/logo-16e39b7fe5b98d81b41aadfeaec922fdd9601db0321cc52f00e84b8476a103c6.png","content":"The U.S. is getting its own version of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThe team behind the annual international song competition is working on the American Song Contest, which will take place during the holiday season of 2021.\n\nIn the Eurovision Song Contest, participants from countries around Europe submit an original song to be performed on live television and radio.

Below, here's a look at how astrology will affect our lives today.\n\nThere's a buzz in the air today with the Moon entering curious and outgoing Gemini in the mid-morning. When the Moon is in Gemini, we usually find ourselves in the mood to socialize, entertain new ideas and learn information, or delve into many interests or activities at a time.\n\nSince the Gemini Moon is also being influenced by chatty Mercury in bold and creative Leo (Mercury is the planet in charge of Gemini), today could also bring some creative inspiration, a breakthrough, or some much needed laughs along with it. Though with the Moon in Gemini and Mercury in Leo, we may need to be mindful of listening just as much as we talk, as Leo is a sign that can sometimes be a bit self-centered.\n\nOverall, if there's any pending emails, conversations, calls, errands, or paperwork that we need to catch up on, today's the perfect day to do it.\n\nRead below to see what the stars mean for your sign today, and make sure to check out your August 2020 monthly horoscope.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Aries (March 21-April 19)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nExpect to be super busy today with all the meetings, errands, and projects you've got on your plate.

Too, creativity is king.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Taurus (April 20-May 20)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nYou've got your mind on your money today, making it a good time to take care of any bookkeeping duties or redrafting your budget. If you're owed money, follow-up on that too. You can get what you want.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Gemini (May 21-June 20)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nIf you're mood has been all over the place, it should pick up for the better today, especially as you're encouraged to pamper and nourish yourself. Too, humor goes a long way. Seek out laughter.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Cancer (June 21-July 22)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nYou might not have a lot of get up and go today. Though now's the time that you should listen to your body and slow down. Your spiritual self could use some extra attention. Time to yourself will replenish you.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Leo (July 23-Aug. 22)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nIt's all about who you know today, as an opportunity could arrive by way of a friend or word of mouth. On another note, when's the last time you've shown appreciation to your friends? Reach out and show you care.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Virgo (Aug. 23-Sept. 22)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nYour goals and ambitions are in the spotlight today and as you survey the progress you've been making, give yourself credit where it's due. Now's not the time for being too humble. Take those compliments.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nIf you're craving an adventure today, perhaps a day trip to an outdoorsy spot could be what you need. If you can't leave, online activities, especially those that are art and culture related could provide a getaway.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nYou might be craving intimacy more than usual today, but you may need to get creative when it comes to bonding with your partner. If single, keep your standards high.

When dealing with others, consideration and care goes a long way.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nYou're in the zone today when it comes to handling your to-do list. Just make sure that taking care of your well-being is on the list as well. You can make lots of progress today. But don't soldier through difficult feelings.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nYou're in need of some joy and laughter today and the cosmos gives you the green light to do it. Delving into a creative project or hobby could also be therapeutic. Romance could also be sweet.\n\nIf Your Zodiac Sign Is Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20)\n\nMargaret Flatley\/Bustle\n\nIf you find yourself feeling tender today, be gentle with yourself.

Paul McGann\u2019s Eighth Doctor could have solely appeared in the 1996 TV Movie, before fading into obscurity \u2013 but by appearing in years of Big Finish audio dramas, McGann kept his version of the Time Lord alive, facing various iconic foes and acquiring new companions as well as legions of fans.\n\nThis, in turn, led to his surprise screen return for the Doctor Who\u2019s 50th anniversary celebrations in 2013, with a special regeneration scene filmed for McGann\u2019s Doctor that filled a gap in Who history while also paying tribute to his time on Big Finish.\n\nBBC\n\nNow, fans are speculating whether Eccleston\u2019s slow thawing in attitude towards Doctor Who could lead to a similar TV return \u2013 or something even more extended \u2013 in the coming years.\n\nFamously, we were already robbed of a Ninth Doctor return back in 2013, when the actor declined to appear in The Day of the Doctor special and John Hurt\u2019s War Doctor was written into the episode to fill the role Eccleston would have had in the story (though a draft script with Eccleston does still exist).\n\nPartially, Eccleston said he turned the opportunity to return down because he thought the script wasn\u2019t good enough, later noting that the finished version with the War Doctor was a much stronger story. But it\u2019s also easy to imagine that his continued mixed feelings about returning to work with Who and the BBC may have contributed to his decision as well.\n\nNow, with a greater awareness of how many fans still love his Doctor (an experience he says has \u201chealed\u201d him somewhat), Eccleston has relented to play the character again. And once he does step into the shoes of the Ninth Doctor again, who\u2019s to say he won\u2019t get a taste for it, and be more open to a screen return? Say, in any potential 60th anniversary celebrations in 2023\u2026\n\nOf course, it could be that Eccleston does no more than this one series of Big Finish dramas, which would still be great \u2013 any more of the Ninth Doctor is a win. And even if he does go on to have a longer relationship with Who through spin-off media, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be keen to work for an in-house BBC production again.\n\nBut on the other hand, a couple of years ago the idea of Eccleston returning to play the Doctor at all seemed unlikely, so we\u2019re keeping hope alive. We know we haven\u2019t heard the last of the Ninth Doctor \u2013 and today, it\u2019s looking more likely that we haven\u2019t seen the last of him either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoctor Who: Revolution of the Daleks returns to BBC One in 2020 \u2013 check out what else is on with our TV Guide"},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/gulfnews.com\/entertainment\/bollywood\/karan-johars-dharma-productions-left-out-of-gunjan-saxena-trailer-1.72971966","domain":"gulfnews.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 06:49:24","title":"Karan Johar's Dharma Productions left out of 'Gunjan Saxena' trailer","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/imagevars.gulfnews.com\/2019\/06\/08\/190608-Karan-Johar_16b372c5909_medium.jpg","content":"There was a time when being under the wings of high-profile Bollywood producer and director Karan Johar was a matter of pride, but his cult status seems to have changed dramatically since the death of Sushant Singh Rajput.\n\nJohar has been accused of promoting nepotism and star kids blatantly in his projects. The charge has intensified ever since the self-made actor Rajput was found dead at his residence in Mumbai on June 14.\n\nAs soon as the trailer of \u2018Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl\u2019 starring Janhvi Kapoor dropped, its producer Johar has been ambushed with online hate and calls for a boycott. Many have been trolling Kapoor\u2019s wooden expressions in the trailer.\n\nReports have pointed out that the name of Johar\u2019s production house Dharma Productions is missing from the poster and trailer \u2014 prompting many to question if the web streaming giant Netflix had distanced themselves from the controversial producer to avoid the movie being adversely affected.\n\nWhen approached by Gulf News, Netflix India said there is no truth in the story doing the rounds that the credits were removed. \"There are no talent or Netflix-specific credits in the trailer either. When the film releases on the service, it will carry every rightful credit relevant, as is the case with all Netflix titles \u2013 films or series,\" a Netflix representative said in a email.\n\nThere have been several calls online to boycott this film as a mark of solidarity towards Rajput, who many feel didn\u2019t get his due in the Hindi film industry since he wasn\u2019t born into a movie dynasty.\n\nJanhvi Kapoor in \u2018Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl\u2019.\n\nKapoor is late legendary actress Sridevi and producer Boney Kapoor\u2019s daughter.

She adds in a lengthy comment, \"There was something that happened recently over KakaoTalk messages with a rep from FNC. The news outlet reports said that she 'begged forgiveness', so I sent a message to an FNC rep saying, 'Begged forgiveness? Please don't lie'. They then responded, 'I'll check', and then a long time later they apparently felt that in their eyes, she did beg forgiveness. How can I accept a proper apology from someone who comes over with her eyes so big and clear, asking me where my knife is, saying she doesn't remember, staring at me right in the eyes with that expression? I might as well give up.\"\n\nMina continued, \"I was so shocked over the FNC rep's KakaoTalk that I tried to cut myself again, and my manager's younger sibling came looking for me early in the morning to take me to the hospital.\"\n\nMina then went on to vent her frustrations at a therapist FNC Entertainment hired for her, claiming that the therapist allegedly leaked personal information about their other clients to her. She also expressed her anger at suspicions that former AOA member\/leader Jimin might \"return to promotions\" once \"things quieted down\".\n\nShe finished by directing a warning to her former agency, stating, \"The right time for a proper apology has long passed, and I would rather that you please just be more considerate of your trainees, your agency artists, singers, actors and actresses, all of the sunbaenims, so that there won't be another person like me who suffers ever again.\"\n\nBack on August 5, Mina was seen sharing a past photo of her days in AOA, writing, \"Jinri, I miss you..\". Many suspected that the \"Jinri\" mentioned in the post indicates the late idol\/actress Sulli.\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this month, Mina accused former AOA member\/leader Jimin of severely bullying her during her idol days.

So that's what I did on this one,\" Swift explained in a clip shared online, before adding, \"I named all the characters in this story after my friends' kids.\"\n\nThe names James and Inez are both mentioned in track, which are the names of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' daughters.

She also gave a shout-out to William Bowery, who is credited with co-writing two tracks on Folklore, and suspected by many fans to be pseudonym for Swift's boyfriend, Joe Alwyn.\n\n\"Can we all please crawl inside that piano with you and live in this album...\" Lively wrote. \"Like you, Folklore is full of heart, soul, humor, passion, intelligence, wit, whimsy, reality, imagination, strength, vulnerability, and above all things: Love.\"\n\nSwift has previously included the actress' oldest daughter, James, on her track, \"Gorgeous,\" off her Reputation album.\n\nFor more from the singer's latest album, including the wildest fan theories, watch the video below.\n\nUpdates on Celebrity News, TV, Fashion and More!

It was planned that the reunion would have a live audience in March 2020. Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic came and the reunion had to be postponed.\n\nThe reunion was rescheduled for May 2020 but it was postponed again because of the pandemic. 51-year-old Aniston spoke to Deadline in August 2020 and she refused to get down about it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be super,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know what?

She posted recently on Instagram, which she just joined in the last year, to support the #WomenSupportingWomen challenge. Aniston accompanied a black-and white-photo with a touching message for women and also encouraging her fans to vote.\n\n\u201cThank you to all the brilliant and beautiful women in my life who sent the most uplifting messages today,\u201d she said. \u201cTruth be told, I don\u2019t really understand this #challengeaccepted thing\u2026but who doesn\u2019t love good reason to support women!

As argued to the expectations, the supporters and fans criticized the production line and the actors for advertising obscenity in the mosque.\n\n\u201cActing at Jamia Masjid Wazir Khan Lahore with the songs of actress Saba Qamar and Bilal Saeed is an insult to the mosque and a moment of concern for Muslims. We strongly condemn this act and demand immediate legal action from the government,\u201d addressed by a Twitter user.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStar Saba Qamar and singer Bilal Saeed are managing on the video of the new number, Qubool Hai, these days in Lahore.

The reality star was caught slinging racial slurs on social media, and admitted to calling her husband the n-word in their private time. Now, given Tania Maduro\u2019s outspoken support for the BLM movement, fans are criticizing her for spending time with Babygirl Lisa.\n\nBabygirl Lisa Hamme admits to calling Usman Umar racial slur\n\nRELATED: \u201990 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019 Fans Bash Babygirl Lisa For George Floyd Sign\n\nRelated post url:\n\n90 Day Fianc\u00e9 star Babygirl Lisa Hamme has not won many fans since her time on the show. In fact, she garnered incredible criticism for how she treated Usman Umar during their time filming together, and for her use of racial slurs.\n\nIn fact, Usman Umar came forward during tell-all filming to break the news. During the footage, Umar said, \u201cLisa, last week you called me n*gger which I know is totally inappropriate in America. You called me n*gger, I don\u2019t even get angry about it because I am used to how you are behaving.\u201d\n\nHamme was not happy with Umar for bringing it up. She said, \u201cIf you start this sh*t again. Do not open that can of worms. Do not. Do not start. Let me tell you something. Listen, if you open that can of worms.\u201d\n\nDuring an interview, she later told Domenick Nati, \u201cNo, that word was used out of context and out of stupidity.

Geoffrey Paschel, another infamous cast member, seems to spend time with Hamme. Paschel currently stands accused of abuse in several relationships.\n\nHamme recently uploaded a photo of herself hanging out with Tania Maduro and Synging Colchester. She added the photo to her Instagram, and captioned it, \u201cHad a fantastic time with @syngin_colchester an @tania.maduro such a lovely couple.\u201d\n\nShe later uploaded another photo of herself with Geoffrey Paschel and Syngin Colcheste,r seemingly from the same day.\n\n\u201890 Day Fianc\u00e9\u2019 stars call out Tania Maduro\n\nBabygirl Lisa Hamme, Tania Maduro, and Syngin Colchester of 90 Day Fianc\u00e9 | lisa_hamme_ via Instagram\n\n90 Day Fianc\u00e9 fans were quick to rip into Tania Maduro for spending time with Babygirl Lisa Hamme. Maduro is an outspoken proponent of anti-racism, and so fans perhaps hold her to a higher standard when it comes to interacting with those who would use racial slurs.\n\nOne Redditor wrote, \u201cWait. Tania who\u2019s so into social justice is hanging out with a white woman who used the n-word? Make it make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cTania is supposed to be woke, but she\u2019s taking a picture with a known racist,\u201d pointed out another user.\n\nOthers echoed similar sentiments.

The blue color wasn't arbitrary. There's a story behind each lightsaber hues, from the red blades wielded by Darth Vader and the Imperial Inquisitors hunting Obi-Wan in his series to the black and white ones ignited in The Mandalorian.\n\nDuring the production of each movie in George Lucas' saga, the lightsabers' blades were actually white. Effects wizards later gave them color using a technique called rotoscoping. And it was concept artist Ralph McQuarrie who decided to associate a blade's color with a character's moral standing. So for this May the 4th, let's take a look at what the characters' color choices say about them, and the history of some of their weapons.\n\n\"I tried to make the laser beam as bright as possible, and I changed the colors for the various swords -- a color for the good guys and a color for the bad guys,\" he said.\n\nThe red blade makes Darth Vader a master of evil. Lucasfilm\n\nIn the decades since, we've seen a whole rainbow of colors -- though many have been consigned to the noncanon Legends continuity of novels, comic books, video games , spinoff movies and TV series that came out before April 2014, when Disney took over.\n\nIn-universe, the color of a lightsaber's blade is determined by the kyber crystal used in its construction. The Gathering, an episode from the fifth season of animated series The Clone Wars, revealed that the quest to acquire these force-attuned crystals is a Jedi rite of passage -- the crystals presenting themselves to worthy owners.\n\nWatch this: Disney's Galactic Starcruiser: What It's Really Like Inside the Star Wars Hotel 29:28\n\nWe'll look at all the different shades of lightsaber, and the characters who wield them. Be warned that great big Star Wars SPOILERS for the movies and shows follow.\n\nBlue\n\nBlue is the color of the very first lightsaber we see, and it's by far the most common hue. Since Luke wields it, one might easily assume that blue corresponds with younger Jedi. However, Obi-Wan used a blue blade throughout his career (it'll appear in his Disney Plus show later this month) and Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber, which passed between the central characters of the saga (from Anakin to Luke to Rey, via Finn), was blue.\n\nRey wields Leia and Anakin's blue lightsabers to deflect Palpatine's Force Lightning in The Rise of Skywalker. Lucasfilm\/Screenshot by Sean Keane\/CNET\n\n\"I knew this lightsaber was the Excalibur of this film,\" set decorator Roger Christian told Daniel Wallace for Star Wars: The Lightsaber Collection. \"I knew it would be the iconic image.\"\n\nThis weapon's kyber crystal can be seen as Rey examines the split hilt at the end of The Last Jedi. She repaired it between that movie and The Rise of Skywalker, when she used it and General Leia Organa's blue-bladed saber to destroy Emperor Palpatine once and for all. Then she retired the two lightsabers in the sands of Tatooine.\n\nLeia's lightsaber hilt was inspired by Luke's second one, according to The Lightsaber Collection reference book. Insight Editions\n\nOther blue users we've seen in canon also include Ben Solo, Kanan Jarrus, Ezra Bridger, Cal Kestis, Shaak Ti, Agen Kolar, Ki-Adi-Mundi, Barriss Offee, Jocasta Nu, Aayla Secura, Plo Koon, Kai Justiss, Sora Bulq and Ferren Barr.\n\nAn experienced Luke Skywalker uses a green blade when he faces his father and the Emperor on the second Death Star. Lucasfilm\n\nGreen\n\nWe first saw a green lightsaber in Return of the Jedi, when Luke ignited his new blade on Jabba the Hutt's sail barge.\n\nThis blade was blue in the initial edit (and early posters), but it was changed to green so it would stand out against Tatooine's blue sky in the final cut. The Star Wars YouTube channel's description for the movie's teaser trailer, in which the blue blade can be seen, confirms this.\n\nLuke can also be seen finishing off the construction of his new lightsaber in a deleted scene from the movie. This lightsaber's fate is unknown -- we see Luke using it in flashbacks during The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, but it likely remains hidden in his hut on Ahch-To.\n\nThe notion of green as the choice of more-experienced Jedi was reinforced by the prequels, in which green blades were used by Qui-Gon Jinn (Obi-Wan's master) and Yoda (the order's grand master).\n\nWatch this: Your guide to Star Wars lightsaber colors 02:16\n\nOn the other hand, Ahsoka Tano, Anakin's Padawan, swung a green lightsaber at the beginning of her career -- adding a second, shorter green blade as she became more experienced during the Clone Wars.\n\nWielders in canon also include Quinlan Vos, Depa Billaba, Bultar Swan, Stass Allie, Luminara Unduli, Kit Fisto, Eeth Koth and Kirak Infil'a.\n\nMace Windu's purple lightsaber was added during reshoots for Attack of the Clones. Insight Editions\n\nPurple\n\nOnly one person in canon wields a purple blade: the Jedi Council's Mace Windu.\n\nHe uses it to decapitate the deadly bounty hunter Jango Fett in Attack of the Clones and to deflect Darth Sidious' Force Lightning with it -- disfiguring his face -- in Revenge of the Sith. It later falls to the streets of Coruscant after Windu is betrayed by Anakin.\n\nIn reality, actor Samuel L. Jackson asked Lucas if his character could have a purple blade so he'd stand out during the climactic arena battle in Attack of the Clones. Since Windu is \"the second baddest Jedi in the universe next to Yoda,\" his wish was granted, Jackson revealed in an interview.\n\nDarth Sidious uses a red blade, which requires that Dark Side users make kyber crystals \"bleed.\" Keith Hamshere\n\nRed\n\nThe color of evil. Those who go down the dark path, mostly notably the Sith, can't form the same relationship with kyber crystals as Jedi, so they must steal them or take them from slain followers of the light.\n\nAfter obtaining a crystal, dark side Force users must make it \"bleed\" by channeling their pain and anger into it.\n\nWatch this: Inside a lightsaber combat lesson 02:35\n\nVader's quest to obtain his crystal and the subsequent bleeding of fallen Jedi Master Kirak Infil'a's green one, during which he experiences haunting visions, can be seen in Marvel's 2017 Darth Vader series by Charles Soule.\n\nKylo Ren's lightsaber is a little different because it uses a cracked kyber crystal, which he may've either broken or had to steal due to his wavering dedication to the dark side. Its origin remains unclear.\n\nThe cross-guard design is necessary because the cracked crystal produces excess heat, resulting in the red blade's serrated appearance and unique sound, according to The Force Awakens Visual Dictionary.\n\nVillains we've seen using red lightsabers include Vader, Sidious, Darth Maul, Count Dooku, Savage Opress, Asajj Ventress, the Imperial Inquisitors and Rey in a vision seen during The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nThe Darksaber's blade is flat, unlike the cylindrical blade of a lightsaber, The Lightsaber Collection reference book notes. Insight Editions\n\nBlack\n\nThe only black blade we've seen is that of the Darksaber, an ancient weapon constructed by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian to join the Jedi Order. After his death, it became a symbol of conflict and ultimately leadership among the clans of Mandalore.\n\nWe first saw the Darksaber in the possession of Pre Vizsla in The Clone Wars season 2 episode The Mandalore Plot, but it later falls into Maul's hands when he seizes control of the planet in season 5, in the years between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.\n\nIn the third season of Rebels, which takes place between Solo and A New Hope, Sabine Wren obtains the Darksaber and proves herself worthy of wielding it through combat. She ultimately gives the blade to Bo-Katan Kryze, a former lieutenant of Pre Vizsla, who uses it to unite the Mandalorians against the Empire.\n\nThe Darksaber resurfaces around five years after Return of the Jedi, in The Mandalorian's season 1 finale, when Moff Gideon uses it to escape his crashed TIE fighter.\n\nMando and Gideon battle, with the fate of Grogu and the Darksaber at stake. Lucasfilm\/Screenshot by Sean Keane\/CNET\n\nGideon was an Imperial Security Bureau (ISB) officer during this event, in which the Empire seemingly slaughtered Mandalorians and scattered the survivors across the galaxy, so he could've taken the Darksaber as a prize to assert dominance over a conquered culture.\n\nIn The Mandalorian's season 2 finale, Mando defeats Gideon and takes the blade -- making him the leader of his people. That created some friction with his allies in The Book of Boba Fett, so we'll see how that plays out in season 3.\n\nUnusually, most of those we've seen wielding the blade (Pre Vizsla, Sabine, Bo-Katan, Gideon and Mando) aren't Force users.\n\nAhsoka Tano and her white-bladed lightsabers made their live action debut in The Mandalorian. Lucasfilm\n\nWhite\n\nWhen Ahsoka makes her triumphant return in Rebels, she uses a pair of lightsabers with white blades. We also saw them in live action for the first time in season 2 of The Mandalorian.\n\nIn the Ahsoka novel, we learn she obtained her crystals when she defeated the Sixth Brother, an Imperial Inquisitor, and healed them of the bleeding effect. This purification is likely the reason for the blades' white hue.\n\nYellow\n\nThe Jedi Temple Guards seen in The Clone Wars wield lightsaber pikes with twin yellow blades. These anonymous masked Jedi Knights protected the temple on Coruscant, but we know at least one of their number fell to the Dark Side and became the Grand Inquisitor.\n\nRey ignites her yellow-bladed lightsaber in the closing moments of The Rise of Skywalker. Lucasfilm\/Screenshot by Sean Keane\/CNET\n\nIn the final moments of The Rise of Skywalker, Rey ignites her new lightsaber and reveals its yellow blade. We don't know where she got that kyber crystal, but her color choice lines up with her being the new guardian of the Jedi traditions.\n\nThe lost colors of Legends\n\nThe Legends continuity might not be canon anymore, but we should acknowledge some of the lightsaber colors it gave us.\n\nEnlarge Image Mara Jade wielded a magenta blade during her time with the Empire. Del Rey\n\nThe majority of the Legends colors are just shades of the canon ones, but there are some exceptions.\n\nMara Jade was one of the most popular Legends characters, having started out as the Emperor's Hand, tasked with killing Luke and going on to marry her former target . As an Imperial, she used a magenta blade and would ultimately inherit Anakin's blue lightsaber after becoming Luke's ally.\n\nKyle Katarn wields an orange lightsaber in the game Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight, as do the Mandalorian Knights in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic: War comic book miniseries.\n\nLowbacca, Chewbacca's nephew who joined Luke's academy, uses a lightsaber with a bronze blade.\n\nIf you want to go further down this rabbit hole, here's a list of 174 characters' personal lightsabers across canon and Legends."},{"topic":"ENTERTAINMENT","link":"https:\/\/www.soompi.com\/article\/1417642wpp\/former-aoa-member-choa-confirmed-to-return-with-to-all-the-guys-who-loved-me-ost","domain":"soompi.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 06:47:57","title":"Former AOA Member Choa Confirmed To Return With \u201cTo All The Guys Who Loved Me\u201d OST","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/6.soompi.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/image\/796233f21ed347c7913f918063dc2890.jpeg?s=900x600&e=t","content":"Updated August 11 KST:\n\nChoa has made her long-awaited return through a new song!\n\nOn August 11 at 6 p.m. KST, Choa\u2019s \u201cHere I Am\u201d was released for the OST of \u201cTo All The Guys Who Loved Me.\u201d\n\nCheck out the music video for the song below:\n\nOriginal Article:\n\nChoa has lent her voice for the soundtrack of KBS 2TV\u2019s \u201cTo All the Guys Who Loved Me\u201d!\n\nOn August 7, the drama\u2019s OST production company confirmed that Choa\u2019s song \u201cHere I Am\u201d will be released through online music streaming sites on August 11 at 6 p.m. KST.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Right Here\u201d was first revealed during the August 3 broadcast while Park Do Gyeom (Seo Ji Hoon) was gazing affectionately at Seo Hyun Joo (Hwang Jung Eum).

Lead author is Daniel Chastain, a clinical assistant professor of pharmacy at UGA's Albany campus. Co-authors also include Sharmon Osae and Henry Young from the UGA College of Pharmacy and Joeanna Chastain from Phoebe.\n\n\n\nIn the nationally funded Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial that is testing the efficacy of the antiviral remdesivir, Black Americans accounted for 20% of the total patient population. In the Gilead-funded clinical trial of the drug, only roughly one out of every 10 patients given remdesivir were Black. Latinx and Native Americans comprised 23% of the former trial and less than 1% of the latter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of the patients in both of those large clinical trials were Caucasians,\" said Chastain. \"Knowing that African Americans die at a higher rate than Caucasians, can I say that this medication will work in them as well? Yes, they enrolled a bunch of patients and yes they got these data out as fast as possible, but can we use this information to inform treatments in all patients?\"\n\n\n\nThe remdesivir trials showed patients given the drug recovered from COVID-19 slightly faster than those who received placebos, but Black, Indigenous and people of color often experience more severe symptoms and complications from the disease. It remains undetermined whether they will respond as well to the medication.\n\n\n\n\"Why aren't we putting up infrastructure for clinical trial sites in areas that were heavily hit by COVID?\" Chastain said. \"If we would've included Albany, those clinical trials would've been more diversified and would've been much more representative of what the coronavirus pandemic looks like in our area and throughout the U.S.\"\n\n\n\nChastain previously co-authored a paper, published in the Journal of Hospital Medicine, urging health care providers to learn from medical mistakes made during previous disease outbreaks and to be more circumspect in using unproven and undertested treatments and therapies on patients.\n\n\n\n\"I think the hardest question to address is what's the harm? I have no idea what the potential long-term complications of these treatments may be. We don't know. That's what makes me the most nervous going forward,\" Chastain said. \"We're so prone and we're taught that you always have to 'do something,' but sometimes doing something is the worst thing to do in that scenario.\"\n\n\n\nReference: Daniel B.

Fortunately, nutritionists at Skidmore College have discovered a workaround: a way to have your beefcake and eat it.\n\nTheir study pitted the standard eating plan of three meals a day (with 15% of your calories coming from protein, 60% from carbs and 25% from fat) against two high-protein diets, in which the protein ratio was doubled.\n\nOne group of high-protein dieters consumed their daily calorie intake over three main meals; the other ate six smaller meals.\n\n\n\nBoth high-protein groups lost more fat than those on the conventional eating plan, but the changes occurred much faster for those who doubled their meal count \u2013 they were also the only group to gain lean mass over eight weeks.\n\nThe scientists attributed these results to a process called thermogenesis: eating little and often increased energy expenditure through digestion. Despite the calorie deficit, the steady supply of amino acids from the protein was also able to stop the subjects\u2019 gains deflating. (Continued below)\n\nA dose every three hours proved to be optimal for protein synthesis, according to a separate study in Nutrition & Metabolism \u2013 and so the six, high-protein meals a day were able to efficiently fuel gains in muscle alongside losses in weight.\n\nHungry for progress?

Find out more and sign up here.\n\nIT HAS BEEN a difficult week for those living in Kildare, Laois, and Offaly.\n\nThe new localised restrictions have shifted their lives into reverse gear.\n\nGiven the high number of new cases identified this week \u2013 reaching almost 100 again yesterday \u2013 there is little argument over the need for new restrictions.\n\nHowever, whether the form they took was the appropriate one has been up for discussion.\n\nThe restrictions are due to remain in place for another week. Both government and health authorities haven\u2019t yet indicated whether they will be lifted or extended further.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s take a look at a snapshot of what we know about the current situation both in LOKdown countries and across Ireland.\n\nThe virus is not localised to hotspots within Kildare, Laois, and Offaly\n\nWe know that clusters are focused in meat processing facilities, but the workers in these plants live and socialise in areas right across those three counties.\n\nActing Chief Medical Officer Ronan Glynn explained that cases have been recorded as far west as Birr and Tullamore, as far east as Maynooth and Clane, and south as far as Abbeyleix and Durrow.\n\nCase numbers need to be much lower\n\nWe\u2019ve seen some worryingly high daily counts, reaching close to if not well above 100. This makes days where we\u2019re skirting around 40 cases seem good. It is a relief in some ways, but we shouldn\u2019t overegg that element of it. \u201cNumbers like 40 seem low,\u201d Professor Philip Nolan said, \u201cBut if you look back over the chart, you have to go all the way back to early June before you see 40.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf it feels like a low number, that\u2019s only because of what\u2019s been happening in the last week. That remains two or three times higher than [what] we were seeing on an average day in late June, early July.\u201d\n\nOther counties have clusters\n\nIt might not feel like it, but the cumulative incidence of the virus indicates that Carlow, Clare, Donegal, Limerick and Wexford are all experiencing outbreaks \u2013 much smaller than Laois, Kildare, and Offaly, but outbreaks none the less that health authorities will be watching like hawks.\n\nThe below graph demonstrates that \u2013 notice the shades of yellow on the left-hand side.\n\nThe R-number is looking reasonably good\n\nWe\u2019ve learned how much new clusters can skew the national picture for our reproductive number, so we shouldn\u2019t put too much stock in it. Professor Nolan said the confidence interval is very wide, and the number is essentially \u201cnot particularly valid\u201d.\n\nThat said, we did get a reading of R1.6 this week, down from R1.8 the previous week, so we should take some small comfort from that. Remove the LOKdown counties, and it\u2019s likely closer to R1.0 in the wider community. Anything at or above one means the virus is still spreading, so R1.6 is bad news, but a good bit better than R1.8.\n\nCommunity transmission hasn\u2019t gone away, you know\n\nThis is the key gauge of whether the new restrictions have worked.\n\nContact tracers have been able to account for the majority of cases in recent weeks, and we\u2019re looking at an average of around 20% of cases being identified as either community transmission or possible community transmission. Of all the numbers released, this is the most crucial to watch \u2013 12 of the 92 cases yesterday fell into this category.\n\nDr Ronan Glynn speaking earlier this week. Leah Farrell \/ RollingNews.ie Leah Farrell \/ RollingNews.ie \/ RollingNews.ie\n\nThe testing regime appears to be holding up well, despite the new outbreaks\n\nThe positivity rate is a metric used to determine whether a country\u2019s level of testing is up to scratch. Ireland\u2019s has gone up slightly, from 0.5% to 1.7%, but that\u2019s still well within the levels considered to represent a good testing regime.\n\nIn contrast, a few weeks ago Mexico had a positivity rate of 66.9%.\n\nWear a mask, maintain distance, wash your hands\n\nBut you already knew that.\n\nAnyone in Ireland can still catch the virus. Whether you\u2019re planning on having a few friends over, heading out to the shops, bringing your children to see the grandparents, devouring a meal and some pints in your local pub, or mapping out a staycation, you still need to exercise as much caution as is reasonably possible.\n\nThis is an extract from today\u2019s edition of TheJournal.ie\u2019s coronavirus newsletter, where we cut through the misinformation to take a look at the latest developments on Ireland\u2019s efforts to fight Covid-19.

The bacteria, which can cause deadly pneumonia, grow in warm or stagnant water.\n\nThe plumbing in buildings that have been closed for months because of the coronavirus pandemic could provide a perfect breeding ground for Legionella and other waterborne pathogens, the CDC cautions.\n\nIt even happened to the CDC itself.\n\n\u201cDuring the recent closures at our leased space in Atlanta, working through the General Services Administration (GSA), CDC directed the landlord to take protective actions,\u201d the CDC said in a statement to CNN.\n\n\u201cDespite their best efforts, CDC has been notified that Legionella, which can cause Legionnaires\u2019 Disease, is present in a cooling tower as well as in some water sources in the buildings. Out of an abundance of caution, we have closed these buildings until successful remediation is complete.\u201d\n\nLegionella bacteria are common in water everywhere. They\u2019re usually only a problem when the water gets aerosolized and people breathe it in. Showers and fountains are common sources. The name dates back to 1976, when an outbreak among people at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia affected 182 people and killed 29 of them.\n\nPeople most at risk include the elderly, smokers, people with suppressed immune systems and diabetics.\n\nLast year, the CDC reports, 4,294 cases were reported. So far this year, 1,813 cases have been reported.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear if the pandemic has worsened the problem, or perhaps eased it because people are not gathering at large hotels or working in big factory buildings as much, said Chris Edens, an epidemiologist on CDC\u2019s Legionella team. He said state health departments that normally monitor and report cases of Legionella infection are tied up dealing with coronavirus.\n\nAnd no national entity systematically checks buildings to see if the bacteria has started growing in the plumbing. \u201cThere is currently no nationwide surveillance of water systems for Legionella disease,\u201d Edens said.\n\nAs people return to work and start to travel more, hospitals and clinics need to think about the possibility of Legionella, Edens said. \u201cFlu and coronavirus are not the only things that can cause severe pneumonia,\u201d he said. If people turn up with pneumonia, it\u2019s worth testing them for Legionella \u2013 especially since it can be treated with antibiotics, unlike flu or coronavirus.\n\nMany different buildings could be at risk, and building managers need to be aware during prolonged closures. \u201cWe are talking hotels, we are talking large office buildings, we are even talking certain kinds of factories \u2026 a lot of those buildings have been shut down,\u201d Edens told CNN.\n\n\u201cThis water has been sitting and could be at risk of Legionella growth.\u201d\n\nPoorly maintained cooling towers are another potential source.\n\nThe fix is not difficult. \u201cYou want to keep the cold water cold and you want to keep your hot water hot,\u201d Edens said. Legionella flourishes at temperatures between 80\u00b0 and 120\u00b0 Fahrenheit. It\u2019s killed by chlorination and other disinfecting routines, but the bacteria can grow into mats that create hard-to-dislodge sludge inside pipes, Edens said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we typically recommend in buildings that have been disused is flushing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat can be as simple as turning the faucet on. Let cold or hot water course through the system. Keep that water moving.\u201d\n\nLegionella is not the only risk, by the way. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of different waterborne pathogens,\u201d Edens said. \u201cThere are certainly other bugs out there.\u201d\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe CDC warns about them on its website.\n\n\u201cThese can include other microbial hazards, such as non-tuberculous mycobacteria, changes in water chemistry that lead to corrosion, leaching of metals (such as lead) into stagnant water, disinfection by-products, and sewer gases that enter buildings through dry sanitary sewer drain traps,\u201d it says."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/7news.com.au\/the-morning-show\/fertility-expert-explains-what-you-need-to-know-to-prepare-for-ivf-and-pregnancy--c-1215536","domain":"7news.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-05 01:09:31","title":"What a second wave of COVID means for you if you're planning IVF treatment","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/7news.com.au\/static\/media\/author-image.3a48478f.jpg","content":"At first, we thought being confined to our homes during the pandemic would lead to a baby boom.\n\nBut recent statistics show quite the opposite - with fears Australia\u2019s fertility rate is heading towards a record low.\n\nWatch the full story above\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nBetween biological obstacles and elective surgery lockdowns, the journey to conceive can be an uphill battle for thousands of Aussies every year.\n\nBut thanks to advancements like IVF, the fertility game has changed forever.\n\nFortunately, parents-to-be who are undergoing IVF are still able to continue their treatment, despite the COVID pandemic which led to a ban on treatments earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cThe government has seen IVF as a time-critical thing,\u201d said Dr Lynn Burmeister.\n\n\u201cWe know patients can\u2019t wait.

As of September 26, 2022, we\u2019re wrapping up the Dispatch.\n\nWe\u2019ve decided to press pause on TCTMD\u2019s COVID-19 Dispatch, recognizing that though the pandemic is not yet over, it has entered a different phase, our readership has a wealth of other sources of information, and our primary focus is cardiovascular disease. Today\u2019s Dispatch will be our last: we will continue to cover any SARS-CoV-2 news as it pertains to cardiology care. We hope the Dispatch has proved useful to people trying to stay abreast of the research and policy news in this space.\n\nSeptember 26, 2022\n\nCOVID-19 hospitalizations are rising in England for the first time since early summer, the Guardian notes, citing the government\u2019s coronavirus dashboard. \u201cAll of the available boosters provide good protection against severe illness from COVID-19 and getting your booster sooner rather than later is crucial,\u201d Susan Hopkins, MB BCh, chief medical advisor at the UK Health Security Agency, is quoted. \u201cAs it gets colder and we head towards winter, we will start to see respiratory infections pick up\u2014please try to stay at home if you are unwell and avoid contact with vulnerable people.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has dropped its requirement for universal masking among healthcare workers \u201cafter a weeklong slowdown in COVID-19 hospitalizations and nursing home infections worldwide,\u201d writes Mariah Taylor in Becker\u2019s Hospital Review, citing CBS news as the source. \u201cThe change is one of the final sets of revisions to overhaul recommendations for COVID-19 since August.\u201d\n\nCanada, meanwhile, announced today that it will be dropping all COVID-19 border requirements, including mandatory vaccines, masks on planes and trains, and the need to fill out digital health information prior to arrival in the country as of October 1. Other countries, including the Netherlands as of September 17, have made similar recent announcements, while Hong Kong, effective today, has eliminated its quarantine policy for incoming international travelers, although mandatory testing and some restrictions on movement remain in place.\n\nResearchers writing in the Lancet Digital Health are making the case for using \u201cpassively collected sensor data\u201d from smartwatches and Fitbits to track and forecast COVID-19 case counts in real time. According to Jennifer Radin, PhD, and colleagues, participants\u2019 daily resting heart rate and step count can be used to identify any \u201canomalous sensor days, in which resting heart rate was higher than, and step count was lower than, a specified threshold calculated for each individual by use of their baseline data.\u201d Their study describes the development cohort and a validation cohort in which data extracted from digital sources correlated significantly not only with real-time COVID-19 averages reported by the CDC, but also with predicted cases 6 and 12 days in the future.\n\nThere\u2019s more evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection to increasing rates of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents. One study in JAMA Network Open, using deidentified data from a global collection of electronic health records, points to a roughly twofold higher risk of new-onset type 1 diabetes at 1, 3, and 6 months after COVID-19 infection in pediatric patients as compared with those with non-COVID infections. A second study, presented last weekend at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting, showed that the risk of developing type 1 diabetes among Norwegian youth increased from 0.08% in those who\u2019d earlier tested negative for COVID-19 to 0.13% among those who\u2019d tested positive. \u201cThe vast majority of young people who get COVID-19 will not go on to develop type 1 diabetes, but it is important that clinicians and parents are aware of the signs and symptoms,\u201d the lead author on the latter paper, Hanne L\u00f8vdal Gulsethm, MD, PhD, is quoted in a press release.\n\nAmid growing skepticism of the ability of at-home rapid antigen tests to track infections and transmissions, a Dutch study in the BMJ shows that the sensitivity of \u201cunsupervised self-sampling\u201d in people with symptoms of COVID-19, using three different antigen tests, decreased during the Omicron period. The addition of oropharyngeal swabbing, from the back of the throat, improved diagnostics, investigators noted. \u201cAfter proper evaluation, manufacturers of rapid antigen tests should consider extending their instructions for use to include combined oropharyngeal and nasal self-sampling,\u201d they propose.\n\nA research letter in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that autoantibodies towards the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) may explain why some people develop myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination. As an article in MedicalXpress summarizing the study explains, IL-1 plays an important role in alerting and mobilizing the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In an analysis of people who developed myocarditis in response to vaccination, however, \u201cwe found an atypical form of IL-1-Ra, which carries a specific chemical modification in form of an additional phosphorylation,\u201d one of the researchers explains. \u201cThe immune system then interprets this as an unknown, potentially harmful structure and thus starts to produce antibodies against it.\u201d\n\nTwo new studies, both published in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging, provide fresh reassurances that myocarditis following vaccination resolves\u2014or starts to resolve\u2014within 6 months of diagnosis. \u201cOf course, we do need long-term clinical follow-up,\u201d one of the study authors told TCTMD\u2019s Michael O\u2019Riordan, \u201cbut this follow-up cardiac MR study supports very good long-term outcomes for patients with vaccine-associated myocarditis.\u201d\n\nSince March 2020, TCTMD reporters and editors have been keeping tabs on breaking research and policy news--our COVID-19 Dispatch is now updated every Monday. If you have something to share, tell us. Our in-depth coverage of COVID-19 and the heart can be found on our COVID-19 Hub.\n\nThe Dispatch will return September 26.\n\nSeptember 12, 2022\n\nFollowing a similar move by American regulators, the human medicines committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended authorization of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccines formulated to protect against the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, along with the original form of the virus. Across the Atlantic, the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) announced Monday that the new vaccines will be available to Americans at no cost \u201cfor as long as the federal government continues purchasing and distributing these COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nIn a discouraging explainer from the Associated Press, scientists say that COVID-19 is not winding down and is likely to \u201clinger far into the future\u201d as the virus gets better and better at evading immunity from vaccination and past infection. \u201cScientists worry the virus may well keep evolving in worrisome ways,\u201d the report says.\n\nPeople who remain unvaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 are 3.5 to 17.7 times more likely to have a hospitalization related to COVID-19 than those who have been vaccinated, regardless of booster status, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine: \u201cThe study results suggest that clinicians and public health practitioners should continue to promote vaccination with all recommended doses for eligible persons.\u201d\n\nUS President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is signaling that its pandemic response is changing, with an eye on a COVID-19 endgame, Politico reports: \u201cBiden health officials are transitioning responsibility for distributing vaccines and treatments to the private market within 6 months. They\u2019re telegraphing an end to the government\u2019s declaration of the pandemic as a national emergency. And they\u2019re spending the last of their cash reserves on a booster shot drive they hope will ward off the threat of a winter resurgence.\u201d\n\nA feature story in Nature explores what scientists have learned from the lockdowns implemented to control COVID-19. \u201cLockdown measures did what they were supposed to. When they were enforced rigorously enough to reduce people\u2019s social contacts sharply, they shrank COVID-19 outbreaks; several studies had demonstrated this,\u201d Dyani Lewis, PhD, writes. On the other hand, \u201cit\u2019s clear that lockdowns had huge costs, and there is debate about the utility of any subsequent lockdown measures. School and university closures disrupted education. Closing businesses contributed to financial and social hardship, mental ill health, and economic downturns.\u201d\n\nSome scientists are warning of a \u201chidden crisis\u201d when it comes to a link between long COVID and suicide, although there are no firm data to back up the concern, according to a Reuters story. \u201cI'm sure long COVID is associated with suicidal thoughts, with suicide attempts, with suicide plans and the risk of suicide death. We just don't have epidemiological data,\u201d one psychiatrist said. He noted that pain disorders and brain inflammation, which have both been associated with long COVID, are strong predictors of suicide. \u201cWe should take this seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nAs CIDRAP News reports, vitamin D didn\u2019t protect against COVID-19 or other respiratory infections in two randomized trials, one from the United Kingdom and the other from Norway. However, the trials \u201caren\u2019t the final word,\u201d according to an accompanying editorial, citing limitations with each. \u201cBoth research teams should be commended for having completed large and well-designed clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic with its unforeseen logistical challenges,\u201d the editorialist writes. \u201cHowever, the null findings of the studies should be interpreted in the context of a highly effective vaccine rolled out during both studies.\u201d\n\nBoth the Pfizer\/BioNTech vaccine and previous infection provide protection against Omicron infection and related hospitalizations and deaths in children ages 5 to 11, according to a research letter in the New England Journal of Medicine. Effects faded rapidly, however, which \u201cprovides support for booster vaccination,\u201d the authors write.\n\nA study out of China shows that inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination with shots from Sinopharm and Sinovac does not have detrimental effects on sperm numbers or motility. \u201cThese findings contribute to increasing data regarding the reproductive safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and can be reassuring for vaccinated male patients who are planning a pregnancy,\u201d the researchers write in JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe loss of the sense of smell may linger for more than year in some patients with long COVID, \u201csuggesting the possibility of permanent sequelae,\u201d according to another study in JAMA Network Open. Of patients with long COVID and self-reported neurologic symptoms, 64% reported some degree of olfactory dysfunction. Women, adults, and those not hospitalized during the acute phase of COVID-19 were most likely to be affected.\n\nSeptember 6, 2022\n\nAfter the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorizations for updated boosters formulated to protect against circulating Omicron variants in the middle of last week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended their use. \u201cIf you are eligible, there is no bad time to get your COVID-19 booster and I strongly encourage you to receive it,\u201d said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD. STAT reporters are answering questions about the new shots.\n\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) released a joint statement on use of Omicron-adapted COVID-19 vaccines, recommending priority use of the boosters among people who are at risk for progressing to severe disease. That encompasses people 60 or older, those who are immunocompromised, pregnant women, and those with underlying conditions.\n\nNew results from three trials presented recently at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2022 have provided additional insights into what works\u2014and what doesn\u2019t\u2014for addressing the inflammation and thrombosis behind poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 of varying severity, as reported by TCTMD. COVID-PACT demonstrated that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation cut the risk of thrombotic complications in hospitalized patients receiving ICU-level care, whereas the ACT trials showed no benefit of colchicine and either aspirin alone (in outpatients) or aspirin plus low-dose rivaroxaban (in hospitalized patients).\n\nMen with low testosterone levels are more likely than those with normal levels to be hospitalized with COVID-19, whereas the odds were no different for men taking testosterone therapy, according to a study in JAMA Network Open. \u201cScreening and appropriate therapy for hypogonadism need to be evaluated as a strategy to prevent severe COVID-19 outcomes among men,\u201d the authors suggest.\n\nCanSino\u2019s inhaled COVID-19 vaccine has been cleared for emergency use as a booster in China, Reuters reports. The company \u201csaid it was uncertain when its vaccine would be able to go to market, since additional administrative approvals are still needed, while sales would depend on the COVID-19 situation at home and abroad, as well as China's vaccination rate.\u201d\n\nA prior bout of SARS-CoV-2 provides some protection against Omicron BA.5 infection, data in the New England Journal of Medicine suggest. Protection was strongest when the prior infection was with Omicron BA.1 or BA.2. \u201cThese data should be considered in the context of breakthrough infections in a highly vaccinated population, given that in Portugal more than 98% of the study population completed the primary vaccination series before 2022,\u201d the researchers say.\n\nSerious adverse events following receipt of one of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were rare among children ages 6 months to 5 years, although local and systemic reactions have been reported, according to data in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Additional papers focus on parental intentions and perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccination in young children and use of booster doses across various demographic groups.\n\nResearchers working on the next generation of COVID-19 vaccines are running into an obstacle when it comes to getting existing vaccines for comparison. Pfizer isn\u2019t sharing its shots, STAT reports, noting that Moderna didn\u2019t provide comments on the issue. Though the companies are within their legal rights to not share their vaccines, \u201csome university researchers argue the posture slows global progress toward more-effective vaccines in the future, especially since the United States has already wasted tens of millions of doses of the COVID-19 vaccines.\u201d\n\nSTAT takes a look at the situation heading into a third autumn living with COVID-19, noting that \u201cgiven how transmissible the SARS-CoV-2 virus is, models anticipate more than 100,000 additional deaths by the time next summer rolls around.\u201d And in a separate Q&A, Maria Van Kerkhove, PhD, the World Health Organization\u2019s technical lead for COVID-19, discusses pandemic fatigue and how to handle the response to the virus at this point. \u201cSo how do we get the messaging right? To say: Live your life. Live it responsibly, be safe, and by being safe, we mean get all the vaccine doses that are recommended for you, fight like hell for vaccine equity in countries that don\u2019t have it yet. Wear a mask when you\u2019re inside, or when you\u2019re traveling, as much as you can. Just think about your daily activities and take some decisions based on your own risk.\u201d\n\nAugust 30, 2022\n\nPfizer will test the effects of a second course of its oral antiviral Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir-ritonavir) in people who experience rebound COVID-19 infection after the first course. The US Food and Drug Administration has given the drug maker until September 30, 2023, to report initial results of a randomized controlled trial, according to Reuters. Recent high-profile individuals who have had Paxlovid rebound in the United States include President Joe Biden, First Lady Jill Biden, and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, MD. Experts who spoke with CNN said such cases are probably more common than data suggest.\n\nIn other news, despite asking the FDA to authorize a new COVID vaccine targeting the Omicron BA.4\/BA.5 variants, Pfizer and BioNTech say a clinical trial to the assess safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of the vaccine has not yet started. According to STAT\u2019s Matthew Herper, this request is part of \u201ca bold and potentially controversial gambit\u201d to get ahead of future variants by arguing that enough is known about both the Moderna and Pfizer\/BioNTech platforms to approve boosters before seeing clinical data.\n\nA committee of the European Medicines Agency will hold a meeting on September 1, 2022, to discuss the evaluation of two applications for adapted mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that more closely match the original strain and the Omicron BA.1 subvariant. The applications are from Pfizer\/BioNTech for Comirnaty and from Moderna for Spikevax.\n\nSpeaking of Moderna, the company announced that it is filing suit against Pfizer and BioNTech, alleging that they used Moderna\u2019s patented COVID vaccine technology without permission. Pfizer and BioNTech, however, deny this on the grounds that Moderna took a \u201cpledge\u201d to not enforce its patents during the pandemic. As Reuters reports, some experts suspect Moderna is trying to pressure them into licensing their technology to protect the platform it \u201cspent a decade and billions of dollars creating,\u201d and because they misjudged how long the pandemic could last.\n\nScientists may be one step closer to letting people know their real-time level of protection against COVID. Writing in Cell Reports Methods, the researchers say a point-of-care or at-home assay using the platform they designed\u2014possibly in the form of a smartphone app\u2014could \u201ccontribute to population-scale serial monitoring efforts to determine the time point at which individuals in the general population, or high-risk occupations, lose protective immunity and benefit from repeat vaccination.\u201d\n\nOne of the largest studies to date, with a wide range of ages, adds more confirmatory data that the risk of myocarditis is low after COVID-19 vaccination, TCTMD\u2019s Todd Neale reports. Among nearly 43 million people who received at least one vaccine dose in England, myocarditis-related hospitalization or death occurred in 2,861 (0.007% of the total vaccinated cohort), with 617 events (0.001% of the total cohort) at 1 to 28 days after any dose of vaccine. In comparison, the rate of myocarditis after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was 0.003% at 1 to 28 days, with most of these events (58.5%) occurring before vaccination.\n\nThe incubation period for COVID has changed significantly since the pandemic began in March 2020. A study in JAMA Network Open found that these windows have decreased as the virus has mutated and produced different variants: starting with Alpha at a 5-day incubation period, Beta at 4.5 days, Delta at 4.4 days, and Omicron at 3.4 days. The researchers say the results \u201cmay be helpful in changing public health guidance on duration of quarantine, outbreak investigation, and contact tracing.\u201d\n\nAs the San Francisco Chronicle reports, some patients with long COVID are so desperate for relief of their debilitating symptoms that they are willing to risk taking elixirs and other oral therapies they read about in online forums, buy stem cells from Mexico, try hyperbaric oxygen, and put themselves through many other unproven and untested supposed cure-alls.\n\nAugust 22, 2022\n\nAnthony Fauci, MD, the longtime head of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a voice of calm and reason throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, announced he is stepping down from his post at the end of the year. As a STAT story notes, Fauci has served both Republican and Democrat presidents over his 38-year tenure, and took up the role of President Joe Biden\u2019s chief medical adviser when Biden took office.\n\nAs of January 10, 2022, fewer than half of American adults who had been fully vaccinated had gotten their booster shots, according to a study in JAMA Network Open. \u201cBoosted individuals were more likely than non-boosted individuals to be male, Asian, more educated and older, and to live in the Northeast and earn a high income, and work in hospitals,\u201d the authors write. \u201cTargeted efforts at populations with low uptake may be needed to improve booster vaccine coverage in the US.\u201d\n\nAmong hospitalized patients, COVID-19 carries a greater risk of venous thromboembolic (VTE) events than does influenza, an analysis of the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Sentinel System, published in JAMA, shows. \u201cClinicians should be aware that there is a sizable risk of venous thrombotic events\u201d in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, lead author on the study, Vincent Lo Re III, MD, told TCTMD\u2019s Todd Neale. \u201cIt particularly occurs within the initial 30 days of hospitalization, and it was associated with a higher risk of mortality.\u201d\n\nThree old drugs\u2014one of which has been widely touted as a COVID-19 treatment\u2014were ineffective at alleviating hypoxemia or preventing emergency department visits, hospitalization, or death. Results for the phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of metformin, ivermectin, and fluvoxamine in adults with overweight and obesity were published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, showing no impact on the primary outcome or the severity of symptoms. Of note, in a prespecified secondary outcome, investigators saw \u201ca possible reduction in a composite endpoint of emergency department visit, hospitalization, or death\u201d with metformin, but those findings, they say, can only be viewed as hypothesis-generating, given the null results for the primary outcome.\n\nAnxiety and depression following COVID-19 tend to be transient, lasting no longer following SARS-CoV-2 infection than after other respiratory illnesses, but other neurological conditions appear more intractable, a new study concludes. According to an analysis of retrospective cohort studies, published in the Lancet Psychiatry, the risk of \u201cbrain fog,\u201d dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy or seizures were still elevated at 2 years. Worryingly, though children tended to have \u201cmore-benign\u201d psychiatric risk profiles post-COVID than adults, they did show similar signs of the same longer-term problems. Also, \u201cthe fact that neurological and psychiatric outcomes were similar during the Delta and Omicron waves indicates that the burden on the healthcare system might continue even with variants that are less severe in other respects.\u201d\n\nIn a Los Angeles Times Op-Ed, cardiologist Eric Topol explores some of the possible biological mechanisms underpinning long COVID, the trials recently launched to look at ways of relieving symptoms, and the steps needed to get ahead of what could be a burgeoning crisis. \u201cFirst off, we can drop the skepticism and denial,\u201d he writes. \u201cLong COVID is real, and it takes a real toll.\u201d\n\nWith each new strain of SARS-CoV-2, the incubation period has gotten shorter, an article in JAMA Network Open makes clear. \u201cIn this systematic review and meta-analysis of 141 articles, the pooled incubation period was 6.57 days,\u201d authors say. But while the incubation period for Alpha was 5.00 days, that fell to 4.50 with Beta, to 4.41 for Delta, and to 3.42 days for Omicron. \u201cIdentifying the incubation period of different variants is a key factor in determining the isolation period,\u201d they conclude.\n\nIn fact, most of the studies used to estimate the window of infectiousness with COVID-19 have been based on \u201cmathematical modelling based on scarce empirical evidence.\u201d Now, a new study using real-world patients and their household contacts concludes that though the median duration of infectiousness was 5 days, two-thirds of people entering the community after a 5-day isolation period would still be infectious, although with reduced viral shedding. Less than a quarter of patients, however, shed infectious virus prior to symptom onset. Full results, published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine, make the case for more use of lateral-flow devices \u201cto safely accelerate deisolation but not for early diagnosis, unless used daily,\u201d the authors say.\n\nMore than 50 sessions and over 150 abstracts relate to COVID-19 in the program for the upcoming European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress, including three Hot Line trials. But according to ESC\u2019s Clinical Program Committee chair, Stephan Windecker, MD (Bern University Hospital, Switzerland), this year\u2019s congress will focus on COVID-19 \u201cto a lesser extent\u201d than the past two meetings. \u201cIn a sense, we wish to highlight all the progress that has been made despite the COVID pandemic,\u201d he told TCTMD. \u201cIt is admirable to see that despite all the limitations in terms of recruitment, but also shortages in terms of staff, so many of these trials have been successfully completed.\u201d\n\nStudents in the Philippines are returning to in-person learning for the first time since the pandemic began, ending one of the world\u2019s longest, strictest educational shutdowns, the New York Times reports.\n\nAugust 15, 2022\n\nBritain is the first country in the world to approve Moderna\u2019s bivalent vaccine targeting two different COVID-19 variants\u2014the original strain as well as Omicron. The New York Times has the story, noting: \u201c In clinical trials, the vaccine . . . generated a good immune response to these two variants, as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants in adults.\u201d\n\nBut Britain is not joining the United States, France, Israel, and Canada in procuring Evusheld, the long-acting antibody combination of tixagevimab and cilgavimab, due to what regulators are calling \u201cinsufficient data\u201d that the drug will be effective against the currently circulating Omicron strains, the BMJ reports. \u201cThe government said that the decision was based on independent clinical advice from Rapid C-19\u2014a multiagency initiative including NHS England, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the National Institute for Health Research, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as well as other health bodies from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 survivors face higher risks of cerebrovascular disease, arrhythmias, inflammatory heart disease (including myocarditis), ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and thromboembolic disorders, according to an analysis of 42 million records in the US Collaborative Network TriNetX, which matched 690,892 COVID-19 survivors to the same number of controls who did not have COVID-19. The risks of myocarditis and pulmonary embolism were higher than the risks of most of the other cardiovascular complications, the authors write in the eClinical Medicine. \u201cClinicians and patients with a history of COVID-19 should pay extra attention to their cardiovascular health in [the] long term,\u201d investigators conclude.\n\nPregnant women vaccinated against COVID-19 actually experienced fewer health events postvaccination than nonpregnant women of similar age, according to Canadian data published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases. Just 7.3% of pregnant women experienced side effects such as headaches, fatigue, and malaise that led to time off work or school, or required medical attention. \u201cLarge, observational studies like ours are crucial for proper understanding of the rates of adverse health events in pregnant women after different doses of COVID-19 vaccination,\u201d lead CANVAS investigator Manish Sadarangani, DPhil, said in a press release. \u201cThis information should be used to inform pregnant women about the side effects they may experience in the week following vaccination.\u201d\n\nHair loss, bronchitis, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, and dyspnea are among the key reasons why people who test positive for COVID-19 end up using more healthcare resources over a 6-month period than their noninfected peers. \u201cHealthcare systems should consider long-term strategic resource allocation in response to the expected elevated healthcare utilization experienced by patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection,\u201d researchers write in JAMA Network Open.\n\nAlso in JAMA Network Open: patients who wear respirator masks such as N95 and KN99-type masks, as opposed to surgical or other masks, are less likely to spread COVID-19 to healthcare workers (HCWs), a research letter concludes. \u201cFor those exposed to patients, positivity was 21% for HCWs using respirator masks and 35% for those using surgical\/mixed masks (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.39-0.61),\u201d but for both mask types, more time spent with patients was associated with an increased risk of infection.\n\nOne of the biggest studies to date tracking outcomes in children and teens hospitalized with either COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection (MIS-C) suggests that more than one in four have lingering health problems 2 to 4 months later. Writing in the August 2022 issue of Pediatrics, investigators for the Overcoming COVID-19 study say that approximately 10% of patients younger than 21 years old, previously hospitalized for infection, had fatigue or weakness, with similar proportions reporting protracted cough and shortness of breath. Headaches, muscle aches, and fever were also reported. All symptoms were also seen among young people hospitalized for MIS-C, but at lower rates than in those hospitalized for acute viral illness.\n\nIn the age of Omicron variants, a whole lot of self-testing is going on, but only a fraction of the results are being reported to authorities who could be using the information to guide public health advice. From October 2021 to May 2022, nearly 400 million self-tests were produced by the four manufacturers assessed in this US study and while not all were distributed, just 10.7 million results were voluntarily reported by users, researchers write in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. These \u201clikely reflect a small fraction of the number of self-tests used,\u201d they note. \u201cPersons who use self-tests should be encouraged to report results to their healthcare providers, who can ensure that they receive additional testing, counselling, and medical care, as clinically indicated.\u201d\n\nAugust 8, 2022\n\nCommunity cases of COVID-19, as well as death rates, dipped last week in the United States, according to nationwide numbers released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Becker\u2019s Hospital Review has a summary.\n\nRollout of Novavax\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine in the United States has been decidedly \u201csluggish,\u201d ABC News reports. Just 7,300 doses have been administered across the country, which is leading the world in COVID-19 deaths; fully 26 million Americans remain unvaccinated.\n\nImmunity against a range of Omicron subvariants seems to be higher among people with \u201chybrid\u201d immunity\u2014conferred by prior infection on top of three mRNA vaccine doses\u2014as compared with people who\u2019ve had three doses but have never had COVID-19, an analysis of virus neutralization titers in Nature suggests. But even in na\u00efve patients, neutralization activity and antibody affinity against the Omicron subvariants is maintained out to 4 months, authors say. \u201cThese findings about hybrid immunity resulting in superior immune kinetics, breadth, and durable high affinity antibodies support the need for booster vaccinations to provide effective protection from emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants like the rapidly spreading Omicron subvariants.\u201d\n\nAmid all of the other havoc SARS-CoV-2 has caused, the virus is now being investigated for increasing antibiotic resistance, a study from Spain suggests. Investigators reviewed studies of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and antibiotic resistance, finding that vaccines in use since 2001 have helped reduced the risk of invasive pneumococcal disease. But resistant strains have emerged during the last 5 years, particularly during 2020. \u201cOur data suggest that the increased proportion of resistant strains during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic should be taken into consideration regarding the use of antibiotics as a routine strategy to prevent bacterial co-infections, as such use could exacerbate the problem of antibiotic resistance,\u201d investigators write in the Lancet Microbe.\n\nOne in eight people who recover from COVID-19 have persistent somatic symptoms out to 150 days, including \u201cchest pain, difficulties with breathing, pain when breathing, painful muscles, ageusia or anosmia, tingling extremities, lump in throat, feeling hot and cold alternately, heavy arms or legs, and general tiredness\u201d\u2014symptoms not seen in a control group without prior COVID-19, Dutch researchers report in the Lancet. \u201cThese core symptoms have major implications for future research, as these symptoms have the highest discriminative ability to distinguish between post-COVID-19 condition and non-COVID-19-related symptoms,\u201d they write.\n\nPrior to Omicron, loss of smell and taste were two of the most commonly reported symptoms of long COVID. A research letter in JAMA Otolaryngology \u2013 Head & Neck Surgery offers some hope, however: \u201cIn this cohort study, 88.2% of patients reporting a COVID-19-related smell or taste dysfunction completely recovered within 2 years [and] a late recovery was observed in 10.9% of patients. The results should be interpreted with caution due to study limitations, but \u201ccontrary to what is often reported, patients should be reassured that recovery from smell or taste impairment may continue for many months after the onset,\u201d the authors say.\n\nThe number of children who died from gunshots in the United States increased during the pandemic, which might reflect the \u201cincreased psychological strain in families in combination with school closures, which lead to greater time spent by children at home, where guns are often kept,\u201d researchers write in JAMA. Fully 8,477 children died of gunshot wounds between March 2020 and January 2022, a figure representing an estimated increase of 733, or an additional 1.12 deaths per day, compared with a prior 6-year period. \u201cThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 752 children died from COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, implying that our estimated increase in child gun-related deaths was comparable with COVID-19-related deaths in children,\u201d the authors write.\n\nPoo is having a watershed moment, according to a BMJ feature. \u201cThe environmental surveillance tool that got its start with polio and soared in popularity with COVID-19 has reasserted its potential to sound the alarm on both old foes and new threats like monkeypox, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization,\u201d Bryn Nelson explains. \u201cThe revelations in our sewage, experts suggest, have offered evidence for why building and maintaining the infrastructure necessary for wastewater-based disease surveillance should be an urgent public health priority.\u201d\n\nAugust 1, 2022\n\nA Reuters story explores how the pandemic may shape up in the coming months as countries in the northern hemisphere look toward a third winter with COVID-19. Though experts are predicting additional surges of infections as people move inside, they say deaths and hospitalizations are unlikely to increase as much due to protection from vaccination (including boosters) and previous infection, the spread of variants causing less-severe disease, and the availability of effective treatments. \u201cThese forecasts raise new questions about when countries will move out of the COVID emergency phase and into a state of endemic disease, where communities with high vaccination rates see smaller outbreaks, possibly on a seasonal basis.\u201d\n\nUS President Joe Biden, who was on the mend after testing positive for COVID-19 on July 21 and testing negative last week, received another positive test over the weekend, STAT reports. That\u2019s being called a case of \u201cPaxlovid rebound\u201d that can happen in patients who have taken the oral antiviral therapy. Though Biden doesn\u2019t have any symptoms, he\u2019s isolating again, according to his physician. \u201cSuch rebound cases following treatment with Pfizer\u2019s 5-day oral antiviral have stumped physicians as they\u2019ve tried to understand how frequently it\u2019s occurring and what\u2019s allowing the virus to come back a second time,\u201d the story notes.\n\nMany of the millions of Americans with long COVID are no longer working, according to a story from NPR. \u201cAs the number of people with post-COVID symptoms soars, researchers and the government are trying to get a handle on how big an impact long COVID is having on the US workforce. It\u2019s a pressing question, given the fragile state of the economy. For more than a year, employers have faced staffing problems, with jobs going unfilled month after month.\u201d One estimate places the number at about 4 million full-time equivalent workers who are out of work due to their symptoms.\n\nA study of US nursing homes, published in JAMA Health Forum, shows that those in states with a COVID-19 vaccine mandate had higher staff vaccination rates compared with facilities in states without such a requirement, with no worsening of staffing shortages. \u201cVaccination increases were largest when mandates had no test-out option and were also larger in Republican leaning counties, which had lower mean baseline vaccination rates,\u201d the authors note. \u201cThese findings support the use of state mandates for booster doses for nursing home employees because they may improve vaccine coverage, even in areas with greater vaccine hesitancy.\u201d\n\nAdult smokers hospitalized with COVID-19 are at a significantly higher risk of developing more severe disease, including the need for mechanical ventilation, and a higher risk of death, when compared with nonsmokers, an analysis in PLOS One shows. \u201cWe have to live with the fact that some people do smoke,\u201d the senior investigator told TCTMD\u2019s Michael O\u2019Riordan. \u201cAnd people who do smoke need to be extra vigilant about the possibility of severe disease so that they can take appropriate measures or extra precautions about being exposed to COVID. If they actually get COVID, they should seek medical help more promptly because the disease can progress very fast.\u201d\n\nInjection-site and systemic reactions are less frequent after a second than after a first booster dose (ie, third and fourth doses) among people 50 and older who previously received two doses of the same mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, according to data in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The vast majority (95%) of events reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) were nonserious.\n\nThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) announced last week that it has begun reviewing data on the use of sabizabulin for the treatment of COVID-19. A placebo-controlled study of hospitalized patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 who were deemed to be at high risk for acute respiratory distress syndrome and death, published last month in NEJM Evidence, indicated the therapy reduced mortality through day 60.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, Americans became increasingly likely to believe that harassing or threatening public health officials because of business closures was justified, according to survey data published in JAMA Network Open. The proportion endorsing harassment rose from 20% to 25% and the percentage supporting threats increased from 15% to 21%. This \u201cstriking finding,\u201d an editorialist says, \u201cshould activate all readers to consider the many ways in which they can advocate for more investment in public health, including advocacy for investment in the training and education of future public health professionals, supporting increased resource allocation to protect the safety and mental health of the current workforce, and individual acts of outreach to support and thank public health workers in our communities\u2014all of which could better protect those workers on whom our collective health and well-being depend.\u201d\n\n"},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/health\/2020\/08\/13\/covid-california-seattle-schools-arizona-children-unemployment\/3357847001\/","domain":"usatoday.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 16:01:39","title":"Coronavirus live updates: Most deaths in 1 day since May; anxious teachers draft wills; Redfield warns of 'worst fall we have ever had'","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/gcdn\/presto\/2020\/08\/12\/USAT\/94108c6f-98dd-4ec1-a670-00d51e76f6f4-VPC_CHILDREN_AND_COVID-19_DESK_THUMB.jpg?crop=1911,1075,x0,y0&width=660&height=371&format=pjpg&auto=webp","content":"On a day when the U.S. reported the most COVID-19-related deaths since May, the elected leaders in charge of bringing economic relief to the nation showed how far away they are from doing that.\n\nA bipartisan deal for a new coronavirus stimulus package appeared hopelessly out of reach Thursday, with congressional Democrats blaming Republicans, Republicans blaming Democrats and President Donald Trump suggesting the talks are doomed.\n\nA Labor Department report issued Thursday on new unemployment claims reflected the mixed bag of virus data, with 963,000 new jobless claims filed. That's the lowest in months, but it was considered a big number before the virus-driven recession.\n\nThe latest daily U.S. death toll was 1,499, pushing the nation's total above 166,000, the Johns Hopkins data dashboard reported Thursday, when the U.S. surpassed 5.2 million confirmed cases. Iowa reported its 50,000th case and Illinois went past 200,000 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warns of a deadly autumn if Americans don't stringently follow individual guidelines.\n\nHere are some significant developments:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Today's numbers: Worldwide, there have been 750,000 deaths and more than 20.6 million cases, according to John Hopkins University data.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 What we're reading: Critics fear the economic downturn could give donors to public universities more leverage to quietly influence curriculum, hiring and scholarships.\n\nStimulus bill negotiations at an impasse\n\nThe parties negotiating a bill to provide relief from the economic ravages of the coronavirus agree on one point: They're at an impasse.\n\n\u201cI want you to see how vast our differences are,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said at a news conference Thursday.

The next day, Trump told Fox Business Network that holding back money from the U.S. Postal Service, sought by Democrats in a relief package that is stuck in Congress, would hamper mail-in voting, which he favors. Trump has claimed without evidence that mail-in voting will lead to widespread election fraud.\n\n-- Hannah Morse, Palm Beach Post\n\nChina says chicken wings from Brazil were COVID positive\n\nA sample of frozen chicken wings transported from Brazil to China tested positive for COVID-19, Chinese officials announced Thursday.\n\nBut there is no evidence that shows the coronavirus can be transmitted by eating or handling food, according to health experts.\n\nHealth officials in the Shenzhen Longgang District inspected imported frozen food Wednesday when a surface sample of frozen chicken wings tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a statement released by the Shenzhen Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters Office.\n\n-- Jessica Flores\n\nPandemic harms US mental health, CDC finds\n\nBesides killing more than 166,000 Americans, the coronavirus pandemic is having a significant damaging impact on much of the country's mental state, according to a new survey from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMore than 40% of respondents who completed surveys during June reported an adverse mental or behavioral health condition, and 11% reported having seriously considered suicide in the previous 30. The study identified young people, racial and ethnic minorities, essential workers and caregivers of adults as being at increased risk.\n\n-- Alia E.

But the study compares the two months after the first recorded death of COVID-19 in New York City \u2013 the epicenter of the U.S. epidemic for weeks \u2013 with the deadliest two months of the 1918 calamity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re comparable events in terms of magnitude,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston and the lead author of the study. \"What our numbers show is that what happened in New York was pretty similar to what happened in the greatest modern pandemic.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2013 Jorge L.

Some of the tests were taken as far back as June 23, it said. The development prompted accusations from those who believe the state is intentionally under-reporting positive results to protect the economy.\n\n-- Jane Musgrave, Palm Beach Post\n\nGeorgia, late to close and early to open, struggling to contain virus\n\nMore than 1,600 students and staff are in quarantine this week as cases continue to rise in Georgia \u2013 a state that has been criticized for its inaction and mixed signaling on the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAmong the last states to institute a shelter-in-place order and the first to reopen businesses, Georgia is now seeing a rising number of COVID-19-related deaths. The state reported 136 deaths Tuesday \u2013 its most in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic \u2013 and another 109 deaths Wednesday, according to the state's department of health.\n\n\"Georgia is very much the poster child for what happens when leadership take a hands-off approach to managing a pandemic,\" said Dr. Harry Heiman, a professor at Georgia State University's School of Public Health.\n\n-- Grace Hauck\n\nMarriage made in pandemic: Empty hotels and colleges needing rooms\n\nHotel chains, including Wyndham, Hilton and Graduate Hotels, are working with universities to house students during the coronavirus pandemic, matching the need of the hotel industry to make money and alleviate low occupancy numbers and universities' attempts to safely bring students back to campus.\n\nBut time will tell if this experiment will help keep students as well as hotel guests and staff safe, or lead to continued complications that come with people congregating in larger groups.\n\nGraduate Hotels has 23 boutique hotels near universities around the U.S. and is \"trying to create as normal of an experience as possible during a very un-normal time,\" said David Rochefort, president of Graduate Hotels. \"We're here really just to provide a very viable option to parents and students that are coming back this fall.\"\n\n\u2013 David Oliver\n\nMore than 100 infections in Indiana schools raise questions about safety\n\nSchools in Indiana reopened early, officially on July 1, and may serve as an indicator of what other states can expect when students return to in-person learning. The initial results raise questions about whether it can be done safely.\n\nThe Indianapolis Star has been tracking the number of cases connected to schools since the reopening and found more than 100 cases across dozens of Indiana school buildings. The state is creating a mechanism to track and report cases connected to schools but has not yet made any of that information public. State health officials said they are considering it.\n\nArika Herron and MJ Slaby, Indianapolis Star\n\nBlack, Latino people 4 times more likely to be hospitalized\n\nBlack people and Latinos are four times more likely than white people to be hospitalized for COVID-19, and Black people are twice as likely as white people to die of the virus, according to a report published Thursday by the National Urban League.\n\nThose health results stem from people of color tending to live in more crowded housing, which allows easier transmission of the respiratory virus, and people of color being less likely to be able to work from home, according to the league\u2019s annual report called \u201cState of Black America Unmasked.\u201d\n\n\"This is a crisis,\" said Marc Morial, CEO of the National Urban League. \"Those that have less access to doctors and hospitals are going to be diagnosed much later.

Studies have found the drug ineffective in treating patients infected with the coronavirus and potentially dangerous to those with heart conditions.\n\nThe request came four days after the Henry Ford system published a disputed study in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases that suggested hydroxychloroquine slashed the COVID-19 death rate in half. The peer-reviewed observational study contradicted other published reports and was called \"flawed'' by leading infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci. The FDA denied the request this week.\n\n-- Kristen Jordan Shamus, Detroit Free Press\n\nBack to school \u2013 and then back home for two weeks\n\nOne day after schools reopened for in-person learning in Martin County, Florida, one class at SeaWind Elementary School was sent home after a student exhibited symptoms of COVID-19, district officials confirmed. The nine students who were in the classroom will be required to quarantine for 14 days, district spokesperson Jennifer DeShazo said. The other students were already enrolled in remote learning.\n\nThe teacher \u2014 deemed an essential worker \u2014 may return to the classroom to live-stream lessons but will maintain a distance from others, DeShazo said.

It's the first time weekly claims have dipped below 1 million in months. But the latest stream of applications still means nearly 56 million Americans have sought unemployment aid in little more than five months.\n\nThe report comes as out-of-work Americans make do without the extra $600 federal weekly benefit that began during the pandemic but ended the final day of July.

The new report comes as countries wrestle with when and how to safely open schools amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The report by the World Health Organization and UNICEF says more than one-third of the 818 million children around the globe who lacked basic hand-washing facilities at their schools last year are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cWe must prioritize children\u2019s learning,\" said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore. \"This means making sure that schools are safe to reopen \u2013 including with access to hand hygiene, clean drinking water and safe sanitation.\u201d\n\nDisney World cast members to get COVID-19 testing after dispute\n\nFlorida will begin providing coronavirus testing for Disney World cast members this week, ending a nearly two-month dispute with a union that represents stage actors at the park. According to Disney, the testing site will be run by the Florida Division of Emergency Management and will be located on Disney property, though not in the park. Testing will be available to Disney employees and visitors, as well as Florida residents.\n\nAccording to Kate Shindle, president of the Actors' Equity Association, the union has signed a memorandum of understanding with Disney for hundreds of actors to return to work. The union began pushing Disney World to offer testing for its members in late June, before the park's July reopening.\n\n\u2013 Curtis Tate\n\nMore COVID-19 resources from USA TODAY\n\nOn Facebook: There's still a lot unknown about the coronavirus.

Some argue that the term \u201csecond wave\u201d is itself unhelpful as, unlike the rise and fall of seasonal flu or the catastrophic second wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic, the causes of this particular resurgence are entirely due to human factors.\n\nThe imposition of extreme lockdown restrictions in most countries around the world earlier this year was an act of desperation; in effect it represented the failure of disease control, not its success. In the absence of a vaccine or a fundamental evolutionary shift in the virus\u2019s properties (it naturally becoming less deadly), the challenges of Covid-19 \u2013 a rapid case-doubling time, the infectiousness of pre-symptomatic cases, and the high mortality and potential for long-term health problems \u2013 that have made its control an imperative will not have gone away. With lockdown being eased around the world, opportunities for transmission have increased, reproduction numbers have gone up, outbreaks have increased in size, frequency and intensity, and renewed restrictions are being imposed in many countries including, on a regional basis, in the UK.\n\nRecently this rise in cases in Europe has led to the imposition of renewed quarantine for individuals entering or re-entering the UK from Spain. While these efforts to prevent fresh introductions arising in the UK are a sensible precaution, it must be recognised that international travel, while fundamental to the way Covid-19 initially spread from Wuhan in China, it is not fundamental to the problem we face now. In the UK and in England in particular, local incidence prior to travel restrictions had remained high. Recent rises in outbreaks in the north of England have led to the reintroduction of local, partial lockdown measures. While there are suggestions that it could be due to either imperfect social distancing, or possibly employment practices, there is no evidence that travel-based introductions are the culprit.\n\nMost of these new outbreaks have occurred in England, and it is here where the greatest concerns lie. As a result, the evidence that these outbreaks are becoming too frequent has now led to a slowing down of relaxation. In Scotland, a more cautious approach \u2013 combined with clear messaging from the devolved government about the approach to reducing lockdown \u2013 and more decisive action on the use of face masks have resulted in higher approval ratings and, therefore, a likely better engagement with Scotland\u2019s approach to control.\n\nCombined with the natural advantages of a smaller, less dense population and a later arrival of Covid-19, Scotland has fared relatively well, despite criticisms of the early government response, disparities in testing rates across care homes and concerns over high death rates in what are some of the most deprived areas in the UK. Now, with few deaths in recent weeks, a path towards eradication is a tantalising possibility. Despite this relative success, Scotland faces many of the same challenges that England faces. Clusters of Covid-19 cases are still occurring, sometimes in the most unlikely places. So long as this is the case, the balancing act between the need for progress towards easing restrictions and the risks of a second wave will continue. With an R number that remains close to one the continued appearance of infection clusters and the prospect of increasing numbers of introduced cases from elsewhere, Scotland\u2019s test and protect system \u2013 like England\u2019s test and trace \u2013 may soon be stressed to new levels.\n\nFurther challenges are likely to arise over the coming months. NHS staff have been stretched in many cases to their limits, and many other health conditions have been neglected in the fight to contain Covid-19. Economic uncertainty continues and the potentially destabilising impact of Brexit looms in December. Winter will likely mean increased time spent indoors and therefore less social distancing, with more frequent contacts in spaces where aerosol transmission is more likely. Cold and humid conditions may also be a factor; these are believed to play a role in other coronaviruses that infect humans and with influenza, and may also be a factor in the risks associated with Covid-19 transmission in abattoirs. Combined with the likely rise of seasonal influenza cases in those same months, the potential for the NHS to become overwhelmed are considerable.\n\nHowever, all is not doom and gloom. While lockdown has not been the cure for Covid-19, that was never its purpose. What it has done is to buy us time. Extensive systems for testing and tracing are now in place and while still subject to criticism, they will get better with experience and effort. Clean face masks and hand-washing will likely help reduce transmission, even when social distancing measures are relaxed. Clinical research has led to better therapies for the severely affected. Better surveillance tools are being developed. While the road remains long, we are now closer to a possible vaccine.

However, a World Health Organization survey of 103 countries between May and mid-July finds COVID-19 has affected dental services around the world in unprecedented ways.\n\nDental officer in WHO\u2019s Department of Noncommunicable Diseases, Benoit Varenne, says 75 percent of survey respondents reported dental services have been completely or partially disrupted because of the coronavirus.\n\nHe says the high-level of disruption is linked to the nature of the work provided by the oral health care personnel.\n\n\u201cAs you know, dentists, dental nurses, hygienists, and dental assistants work in close contact with patients and are exposed to saliva and blood, and as so, they are using, what we call, spray-generating equipment \u2026 and all this equipment are generating, what we call, airborne particles or aerosol,\u201d said Varenne.\n\nIn communities where transmission of the coronavirus is high, Varenne says WHO recommends priority be given to urgent or emergency oral cases. And in the treatment of patients, he says dental workers should avoid or minimize procedures that may generate aerosols, which can spread the infection and prioritize the use of hand instruments.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, to delay routine, non-essential oral health care,\u201d said Varenne. \u201cThis means going for a checkup, dental cleaning, preventive care and certainly also some aesthetic dental treatment.\u201d\n\nOther WHO recommendations include remote screening, maintaining physical distancing and wearing masks before and in-between dental sessions to prevent and reduce the risk of transmission.\n\nVarenne says one of the most pressing issues is to ensure all dental workers have personal protective equipment. This is essential, he says, to protect themselves from becoming infected with COVID-19 and passing it on to their patients.\n\nCredit : Voice of America (VOA)"},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.sheppnews.com.au\/news\/2020\/08\/07\/1493556\/greater-shepparton-records-four-active-cases","domain":"sheppnews.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-07 07:39:36","title":"Greater Shepparton records four active cases","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.ew.mmg.navigacloud.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2021\/09\/14100526\/shepparton-news.png","content":"A staff member at First Choice Liquor Shepparton and another at Shepparton Retirement Villages in addition to a contactor at Unilever Tatura have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nVictoria has recorded 450 new cases of coronavirus since Thursday, with the total number of cases now at 13,867.\n\nWithin Victoria, 42 of the new cases are linked to outbreaks or complex cases and 408 are under investigation.\n\nThere have been 11 new deaths from COVID-19 reported since yesterday.

However, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), a leading cancer care organization, just issued a warning to patients with cancer to avoid home-based infusion therapy of treatments including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and related medications.\n\nThe warning follows a recent relaxing of the rules allowing such therapy at home during the pandemic.\n\nLast year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) finalized a rule to create a benefit for home infusion therapy beginning in 2021.\n\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, however, CMS introduced additional flexibility to the rule, immediately allowing healthcare professionals and patients to engage in home-based anticancer infusion therapy.\n\n\u201cThe question from our members is: Is this a safe thing to do, and is it something we should address?\u201d Stephen Grubbs, MD, ASCO\u2019s vice president of clinical affairs.\n\nRELATED: Cancer Experts Express Concern About How COVID-19 Is Impacting People With Cancer\n\nCan Infusion Based Cancer Therapy Be Given Safely at Home?\n\nAccording to ASCO position statement, published on the ASCO website, there is insufficient evidence comparing the safety of home-based infusions with traditional infusion center treatment.\n\nMoreover, some of the practices used at infusion centers to ensure safety are impossible to follow at home, according to the statement.\n\n\u201cThere is a paucity of data suggesting the safety portion of it,\u201d he said. \u201cASCO has some very strict chemotherapy safety standards that were developed. ... The question is can you apply those very important safety standards into other outpatient settings,\u201d such as a home.\n\nConcerns over home-based anticancer infusion therapy range from the safe handling of the drugs to the potential for allergic reactions that might require emergency treatment, he said.\n\n\u201cCustody of care of the drugs is a concern,\u201d Dr. Grubbs said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the outpatient fusion area, the custody of the drugs remains with the pharmacy and pharmacist. When you\u2019re doing this at home, the custody of drugs changes.\u201d\n\nThere are also other practical problems, such as how to clean up a drug spill. Many anticancer infusion medications are toxic.\n\n\n\nDoes Home-Based Infusion Therapy for Cancer Ever Make Sense?\n\nThere may be unique circumstances where home-based anticancer infusion therapy makes sense, Grubbs said. However, the position statement calls for collecting data to evaluate its safety. \u201cWe need more research and evidence to see how it applies in the home setting,\u201d he said.\n\nASCO has called on CMS to consult with oncology experts before implementing the home infusion benefit in 2021 and recommends home-based infusion be limited to \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d when the benefits of treatment at home clearly outweigh the potential risks.\n\nThe oncology community has grappled with how to continue to care for cancer patients during the pandemic, Grubbs acknowledged. But ongoing studies suggest that many cancer patients can continue with their treatments at hospitals and clinics."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/extra.ie\/2020\/08\/06\/news\/irish-news\/covid-cases-deaths","domain":"extra.ie","published_date":"2020-08-06 17:55:03","title":"Five COVID-19 deaths and cases increase by 69 as ICU numbers rise","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/extra.ie\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/extra-logo-small.webp","content":"A further five people have died of COVID-19 in the Republic of Ireland, the Department of Health announced on Thursday.\n\nThe country\u2019s death toll now stands at 1,768.\n\nToday's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAn additional 69 new cases of coronavirus were also confirmed, bringing the total number of diagnoses to 26,372 .\n\nOf the cases notified today;\n\n37 are men \/ 31 are women\n\n65% are under 45 years of age\n\n39 are confirmed to be associated with outbreaks or are close contacts of a confirmed case\n\nTwo cases have been identified as community transmission\n\n22 cases are located in Offaly, 19 in Kildare, eight in Laois, six in Dublin, and 14 are spread across eight other counties (Clare, Cork, Donegal, Galway, Limerick, Louth, Meath and Wexford).\n\nThursday\u2019s figures come as the number of patients in ICU with \u2018suspected\u2019 COVID-19 has increased dramatically in the past 24 hours.\n\nAs of 6.30pm on Wednesday evening, there were 14 people in ICU with suspected COVID-19 \u2014 a rise of six since Tuesday\u2019s figure of eight cases in ICU.\n\nThere has, however, been a decrease in the number of people in hospital being treated for the virus.\n\nA health expert has also warned that Ireland needs to change its COVID-19 policy and keep cases down if it wants to avoid local lockdowns.\n\nTrinity Professor Tomas Ryan has said that the Irish Government\u2019s COVID-19 approach is \u2018not working\u2019.\n\n\u2018What we\u2019re doing is not working and we need to think about making some changes,\u2019 Professor Ryan said.\n\n\u2018Clearly cases are still rising and it doesn\u2019t feel like we have any control of this.\n\n\u2018The problem is they were spreading the virus for at least a couple of days before that because our test, trace, isolation structure is still not fast enough.\n\n\u2018\u2026 Even beyond the next couple of weeks, as we move into September, we deal with bigger challenges than we have been facing, when schools open and pubs open.\n\n\u2018As winter comes and flu season comes, we need a more robust system to be doing this.

The findings were published August 12, 2020, in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\u201cReduced tobacco consumption in the U.S. has been associated with a progressive decrease in lung cancer deaths that started around 1990 in men and around 2000 in women. Until now, however, we have not known whether newer treatments might contribute to some of the recent improvement,\u201d said Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., NCI deputy director and co-author of this study. \u201cThis analysis shows for the first time that nationwide mortality rates for the most common category of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, are declining faster than its incidence, an advance that correlates with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of several targeted therapies for this cancer in recent years.\u201d\n\nIn this study, researchers looked at data for both NSCLC, which accounts for 76% of lung cancer in the U.S., and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts for 13% (other subtypes of lung cancer that constitute the remaining share of cases were not covered in this study). In the last decade, new treatments for NSCLC have become available, including those that target genetic changes seen in some NSCLC tumors as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors that help the immune system better attack NSCLC. In contrast, there have been limited treatment advancements for SCLC.\n\nAlthough death records do not distinguish between lung cancer deaths attributable to NSCLC versus SCLC, the cancer diagnosis records compiled by NCI\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry program do distinguish between these two subtypes of lung cancer. Therefore, the researchers were able to estimate lung cancer mortality trends for these specific lung cancer subtypes by linking the lung cancer death records for each patient back to the incidence data for these patients in the SEER cancer database.\n\nThe researchers found that, in recent years, deaths from NSCLC decreased even faster than the decrease in NSCLC incidence and the decrease in deaths was associated with a substantial improvement in survival. Among men, for example, deaths from NSCLC decreased 3.2% annually from 2006 to 2013 and 6.3% annually from 2013 to 2016, whereas incidence decreased 1.9% annually during 2001 to 2008 and 3.1% annually from 2008 to 2016.\n\nTwo-year survival for men with NSCLC improved over this time, from 26% for patients diagnosed in 2001 to 35% for those diagnosed in 2014. Similar improvement was observed for women. In addition, improvements in two-year survival were seen for all races\/ethnicities, despite concerns that the newer cancer treatments, many of which are expensive, might increase disparities.\n\nThe researchers had originally considered the possibility that lung cancer screening might help explain the decreases in NSCLC mortality, but their findings suggest that lung cancer screening rates, which remained low and stable, do not explain the mortality declines. Instead, the rapid decline in deaths reflects both declines in incidence (due in large part to reductions in smoking) and improvement in treatment.\n\nIn contrast, the decrease in deaths from SCLC corresponded with the decrease in incidence, and two-year survival was largely unchanged. Among men, for example, deaths declined 4.3% annually and incidence 3.6% annually. Findings were similar among women. The reduced mortality from SCLC over time, therefore, primarily reflects declines in incidence \u2014 again, due largely to reduced smoking.\n\nThe researchers note that the accelerating decline in NSCLC mortality that began in 2013 corresponds with the time when clinicians began routinely testing patients for genetic alterations targeted by newly approved drugs. In 2012, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommended that all patients with nonsquamous NSCLC undergo genetic testing. Subsequently, genetic testing for EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) gene rearrangements \u2014 which are targeted by the newer treatments \u2014 increased substantially. Because immune checkpoint inhibitors were not in widespread use over the period of the analysis, the authors suspect that most of the survival benefit was attributable to effective EGFR or ALK inhibitors or other advances in therapy. The effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors on NSCLC survival is significant, which suggests that this improving trend in survival should continue beyond 2016.\n\n\u201cThe survival benefit for patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with targeted therapies has been demonstrated in clinical trials, but this study highlights the impact of these treatments at the population level,\u201d said Nadia Howlader, Ph.D., of NCI\u2019s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, who led the study. \u201cWe can now see the impact of advances in lung cancer treatment on survival.\u201d\n\nAbout the National Cancer Institute (NCI): NCI leads the National Cancer Program and NIH\u2019s efforts to dramatically reduce the prevalence of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers.

They complete this epic journey simply by wiggling their tail, moving fluid to swim forwards. Though over 50 million sperm will fail to reach the egg \u2014 the equivalent to more than six times the entire population of London or New York \u2014 it only takes one single sperm in order to fertilize an egg that will eventually become a human being.\n\nSperm was first discovered in 1677 \u2014 but it took roughly 200 years before scientists agreed on how humans are actually formed. The \"preformationists\" believed that each spermatozoa contained a tiny, miniaturized human \u2014 the homunculus. They believed that the egg simply provided a place for the sperm to grow.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"epigenesists\" argued that both males and females contributed to form a new being, and discoveries in the 1700s showed more evidence for this theory. Though scientists now better understand the role that sperm plays in reproduction, the latest research has discovered that sperm have actually been fooling scientists this whole time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSperm were thought to swim like eels\n\nOne of the first microscopes was developed in the 17th century by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. He used a blob of molten glass that he carefully ground and polished to create a powerful lens. Some of them could magnify an object 270 times. Remarkably, a better lens was not created for over 200 years.\n\nLeeuwenhoek's lenses made him the first explorer of the microscopic world, able to see objects including bacteria, the inside of our cells \u2014 and sperm. When Leeuwenhoek first discovered sperm, he described it as a \"living animalcule\" with a \"tail, which, when swimming, lashes with a snakelike movement, like eels in water.\"\n\nStrikingly, our perception of how sperm swims hasn't change since. Anyone using a modern microscope today still makes the very same observation: sperm swim forward by wiggling their tail from side-to-side. But as the latest research shows, we've actually been wrong about how sperm swim for the last 350 years.\n\nSperm spin, not swim\n\nUsing state-of-the-art 3D microscopy technology, a team of researchers from the UK and Mexico were able to mathematically reconstruct the rapid movement of the sperm tail in 3D. Not only does sperm's size make them difficult to study \u2014 their tails only measure half a hair's breadth \u2014 they're also fast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tail's whip-like movement is capable of beating over than 20 swimming-strokes in less than one second. We needed a super-fast camera capable of recording over 55,000 pictures in one second mounted in a fast oscillating stage to move the sample up and down at an incredibly high rate \u2014 effectively scanning the sperm tail while swimming freely in 3D.\n\nWhat we found surprised us. We discovered that the sperm tail is in fact wonky and only wiggles on one side. While this should mean the sperm's one-sided stroke would have it swimming in circles, sperm have found a clever way to adapt and swim forwards: They roll as they swim, much like the way otters corkscrew through water. In this way, the wonky one-sided stroke evens out as sperm rolls allowing it to move forwards.\n\nThe sperm's rapid and highly synchronized spinning causes an illusion when seen from above with 2D microscopes \u2014 the tail appears to have a side-to-side movement. However, this discovery shows that sperm have developed a swimming technique to compensate for their lopsidedness. In doing so they have also ingeniously solved a mathematical puzzle: by creating symmetry out of asymmetry.\n\nA gif of sperm entering eggs. Genome Research Limited\n\nThe sperm body spins at the same time that the tail rotates around the swimming direction. Sperm \"drills\" into the fluid like a spinning top by rotating around itself whilst its tilted axis rotates around the center. This is known in physics as precession, much like the precession of the equinoxes in our planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should be looking for unhealthy sperm in 3D\n\nComputer-Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) systems, in use today in clinics and for research, still use 2D views of the sperm's movement. Like Leeuwenhoek's first microscope, they are still prone to this illusion of symmetry while assessing semen quality. Symmetry (or the lack of it) is one identifying trait that may impact fertility.\n\nThe scientific tale of the sperm tail follows the route of every other area of research: Advances in understanding sperm movement are highly dependent upon the development of technologies in microscopy, recording and, now, mathematical modeling and data analysis. The 3D microscopy technology developed today will almost certainly change the way we analyze semen in future.\n\nA sperm and an egg. Shutterstock\n\nThis latest discovery, with its novel use of 3D microscope technology combined with mathematics, may provide fresh hope for unlocking the secrets of human reproduction. With over half of infertility caused by male factors, understanding the human sperm tail is fundamental for future diagnostic tools for identifying unhealthy sperm, and improving fertility."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.moreechampion.com.au\/story\/6869919\/us-woman-has-second-face-transplant\/","domain":"moreechampion.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-07 18:24:33","title":"US woman has second face transplant","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.moreechampion.com.au\/images\/transform\/v1\/crop\/frm\/silverstone-feed-data\/9ace8697-161d-4077-b688-ef5eb5e8e274.jpg\/r0_0_800_600_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg","content":"\"This face looks very different than my first one and I can appreciate that.

scientists | Photo Credit: iStock Images\n\nBerlin, Aug 11 (PTI) The novel coronavirus can be inactivated using commercially available mouthwashes, according to a study which says gargling with these products may reduce the quantities of viral particles in the mouth and throat, and possibly reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission over the short term.\n\nHowever, the study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, cautions that mouthwashes are not suitable for treating COVID-19 infections or protecting oneself against catching the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAccording to the researchers, including those from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany, high quantities of the virus particles, or viral load, can be detected in the oral cavity and throat of some COVID-19 patients.\n\nThey added that the main route of transmission of the virus likely involves direct contact with respiratory droplets of infected individuals, produced during sneezing, coughing, or talking, and the subsequent contact to nasal, oral or ocular mucosal membranes of healthy individuals.\n\nThe researchers believe the study's findings might help reduce the risk of this form of transmission, and potentially help develop protocols for dental treatments.\n\nThey said the findings \"support the idea that oral rinsing might reduce the viral load of saliva and could thus lower the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\"\n\n\"Our findings clearly advocate the evaluation of selected formulations in clinical context to systematically evaluate the decontamination and tissue health of the oral cavity in patients and healthcare workers to potentially prevent virus transmission,\" the scientists wrote in the study.\n\nIn the research, they tested eight mouthwashes with different ingredients that are available in pharmacies in Germany.\n\nThe scientists mixed each mouthwash with virus particles and a substance which was intended to recreate the effect of saliva in the mouth.\n\nThey then shook the mixture for 30 seconds to simulate the effect of gargling, and tested it in Vero E6 cells, which, according to the researchers, are \"particularly receptive\" to SARS-CoV-2, to determine the quantities of the virus particles.\n\nIn order to assess the efficacy of the mouthwashes, the scientists also treated the virus suspensions with cell culture medium instead of the mouthwash before adding them to the lab-grown cells.\n\nWhile all of the tested preparations reduced the initial virus count, the study noted that three mouthwashes reduced it to such an extent that no virus could be detected after an exposure time of 30 seconds.\n\nHowever, the scientists cautioned that the effect and its duration remain to be confirmed in clinical practice.\n\nAccording to the researchers, mouthwashes are not suitable for treating COVID-19.\n\n\"Gargling with a mouthwash cannot inhibit the production of viruses in the cells, but could reduce the viral load in the short term where the greatest potential for infection comes from, namely in the oral cavity and throat. and this could be useful in certain situations, such as at the dentist or during the medical care of Covid-19 patients,\" explained study co-author Toni Meister from Ruhr University Bochum.\n\nThe scientists are examining the possibilities of a clinical study on the efficacy of mouthwashes on SARS-CoV-2 during which the scientists want to test whether the effect can also be detected in patients and how long it lasts."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/cities\/pune\/first-sero-survey-shows-extensive-spread-of-covid-19-from-36-1-to-65-4-in-selected-areas-sampled-in-pune-6558853\/","domain":"indianexpress.com","published_date":"2020-08-17

the first sero survey conducted in the city indicates extensive spread of Covid-19 in the city, which is not unusual, as per scientists and epidemiologists. Results of the serosurveillance, however, also show that an average of 51.5 per cent people, tested in high-prevalence areas, have antibodies against the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).\n\nThe first round of sero surveys showed 23 per cent people had antibodies in Delhi, while in Mumbai, at least 57 per cent people had antibodies in slum areas and 16 per cent in non-slum areas. In Ahmedabad, it was 47 per cent.\n\n\u201cA similar trend was reflected in Pune as the number of cases by July was quite high here. We expected extensive spread of Covid-19 in selected areas with high incidence,\u201d Dr Aurnab Ghose, associate professor at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) told The Indian Express. He is also one of the principal investigators of the serosurveillance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEarlier, during a press conference online, Divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao presented results of the serological surveillance project. This is a joint venture of the PMC, IISER, Pune University, Translational Health Sciences and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad, and Christian Medical College, Vellore. The team was guided by Dr L S Shashidhara, professor at Ashoka University, who said the study was carefully designed to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 in PMC limits. Persistent Foundation funded the study, estimated at Rs 75 lakh, and the ELISA-based test was developed at THSTI.\n\nThe aim was to estimate a proportion of the population in high-incidence areas of the PMC that had been infected, and had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, said Prof Aarti Nagarkar, director of Interdisciplinary School of Health Sciences at Pune University.\n\nThe serological study reported an extensive spread of the infection, ranging from 36.1 per cent to 65.4 per cent in selected areas sampled in Pune city across all types of dwellings.\n\nA total of 63 locations from high-incidence prabhags of Kasba Peth-Somwar Peth, Rasta Peth-Raviwar Peth, Lohiyanagar-Kasewadi, Yerawada, and Navi Peth-Parvati were randomly selected while blood samples from 1,664 people, chosen as per the study design, were collected between July 20 and August 5. These were then processed to detect the presence of IgG antibodies (antibodies are detected in the blood from ~15 days after infection). The presence of antibodies was highest in prabhag 19 of Lohiyanagar-Kasewadi, 56.7 per cent in prabhag 21 of Navi Peth-Parvati, 56.6 per cent in prabhag 6 of Yerwada, and lowest at 36 per cent in Kasba Peth-Somwar Peth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe study showed a high seropositivity of 43.9 per cent among people living in bungalows, while it was 56 per cent to 62 per cent in those living in tenements or hutment dwellings. People living in apartments have lower prevalence at 33 per cent. The prevalence is 45.3 per cent among people with access to independent toilets as against 62.2 per cent who share toilets. There was no difference between men (52.8 per cent) and women (50.1 per cent), while the elderly (those aged above 66) have a lower prevalence at 39.8 per cent.\n\nSerological testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a representative sample population can estimate the cumulative incidence of infection in the population, said Dr Ghose. The presence of antibodies indicates that the individual was infected in the past and mounted an immune response to the infection.\n\n\u201cThis high prevalence, however, does not necessarily suggest immunity from subsequent infection,\u201d he said. The scientist also explained that the possibility of a person having protective antibodies could not be ruled out and further studies were required.\n\n\u201cAt our end, we will test a small number of samples to find if the antibodies have a neutralising effect and actually prevent the virus from infecting the person,\u201d Dr Ghose told The Indian Express."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/india\/story\/researchers-identify-73-novel-variants-of-coronavirus-strain-in-odisha-1711458-2020-08-15","domain":"indiatoday.in","published_date":"2020-08-15 06:53:39","title":"Researchers identify 73 novel variants of coronavirus strain in Odisha","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/sites\/indiatoday\/resources\/img\/default-690x413.png","content":"A team of genomic researchers from two institutes has identified 73 novel variants of the Covid-19 strain in Odisha, its head has said.\n\nThe researchers are from CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi and Institute of Medical Sciences and SUM Hospital, Bhubaneswar, he said.\n\n\"The research team, which carried out sequencing of 1,536 samples including 752 clinical samples, reported two lineages -- B.1.112 and B.1.99 -- for the first time in India,\" Dr Jayashankar Das, lead investigator and director (research) of the IMS and SUM Hospital, said on Friday.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIf one gets to know the detailed character of the novel coronavirus, it will be very easy to treat patients and cure them, he said.\n\nThe research team, supported by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), validated the most-advanced Covid-19 sequencing technology.

The cutting edge approaches used will help future children affected by Covid-19,\" Scholefield said.The scientists identified large changes in the the immune system's monocyte cells among children with both diseases.While the novel coronavirus usually causes only mild respiratory infection in children and young adults, in rare cases, they may subsequently develop PIMS-TS - presenting with fever, inflammation and evidence of organ failure resulting in cardiac dysfunction, hypotension and life-threatening shock, the study noted.According to the researchers, PIMS-TS shares clinical features with Kawasaki's Disease.They said this disease can cause inflammation of heart muscle if left untreated, and is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed nations.Given the recent emergence of PIMS-TS, the scientists said very little is known about the immunological processes driving the condition, and whether these are similar or different to Kawasaki's Disease."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/life-style\/health\/1320123\/vitamin-b12-deficiency-signs-symptoms-struggling-to-lose-weight-supplements","domain":"express.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-07 17:14:07","title":"Vitamin B12 deficiency: Struggling to lose weight?

Valued for versatility and convenience, the buffs allow workers to drop the covering from their noses and mouths to cool faces, untrap carbon dioxide in exhalations or allow eye protection to defog.\n\nStudy authors describe it as a demonstration about how best to measure face-covering effectiveness at low cost. No specific industry use was involved. But the analysis places a lightweight buff, the only one of its kind tested, dead last in limiting virus spread, contending that the fabric actually breaks down heavier droplets into smaller aerosol micro-drops that may travel farther and float in the air longer than heavier droplets.\n\nThat actually makes the covering using the thin fabric tested worse than no face covering at all, the authors conclude.\n\nTo test the buffs or fleeces, the authors selected one made of a thin polyester and spandex, a product that provides a breathable fabric ideal for keeping cool. But the thin fabric, the Duke team found, transmitted numerous droplets and filtered them into smaller pieces. \u201cThat\u2019s primarily why they got through\u201d the protection, Martin C. Fischer, a research professor in the department of chemistry and one of the authors, said by email. By transmitting smaller aerosol micro-drops, the fleece also may send the virus farther than heavier, fasting-falling droplets would travel without a mask.\n\n\"We noticed that speaking through some masks (particularly the neck fleece) seemed to disperse the largest droplets into a multitude of smaller droplets, which explains the apparent increase in droplet count relative to no mask in that case,\" the researchers wrote in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\u201cConsidering that smaller particles are airborne longer than large droplets (larger droplets sink faster), the use of such a mask might be counterproductive.\u201d \u2013 Duke University researchers, writing in journal Science Advances\n\n\"Considering that smaller particles are airborne longer than large droplets (larger droplets sink faster), the use of such a mask might be counterproductive,\" they wrote.\n\nThe Duke analysis expands the universe of scholarly research on face coverings. It already includes conclusions generated after prior pandemics and other analysis begun during the present coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBut the issue is further complicated by the political climate in the U.S., where anti-mask and anti-lockdown sentiment has turned masks into cultural crowbars, observers say.\n\nCloth coverings had already been targeted as weak links in the protective system because of their need to be washed regularly and because of what some critics said was the danger of transferring virus to faces while adjusting, removing or fidgeting with the masks.\n\nThe six-author team that created the study consists of faculty or researchers in Duke's departments of Psychology & Neuroscience, Chemistry, Physics, and Radiology and in its School of Medicine. They used an unusual measuring technique in which a subject wearing a face covering speaks in the direction of an expanded laser beam inside a dark enclosure. A cell phone camera video captures the scattered light as droplets filtered through the covering.\n\nThe study team took 14 common face-covering designs and tested them with a single speaker; researchers also tested several types with four different speakers. The mask types ranged from a typical, three-layer surgical mask to valved and unvalved N95 masks and to masks of layered combinations of cotton and polypropylene and ones with pleats.\n\n[For ENR\u2019s latest coverage of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, click here]\n\nDuring a control trial, the speaker wore no protective mask or covering.\n\nThe first 10 seconds of the video serve as a silent baseline. For each test, the speaker said, \"Stay healthy, people\" five times. In the next 10 seconds, the mask wearer repeated the sentence five times, after which the camera kept recording for an additional 20 seconds. For each mask and for the control trial, this protocol was repeated 10 times.\n\nThe team found that the traditional cone-shaped N95 masks, which unlike buffs or gaiters, are rated as personal protective equipment by federal agencies, are most effective in stopping droplet-related spread.\n\nDifferent types of fleece masks, with different test subjects, could produce different results. \u201cWe expect there are variations of performance\u201d and \u201cthere are just too many different mask types to test them all,\u201d Fischer says.\n\nThe study complicates an already cluttered landscape of virus-related protections for workers and places workers and employers in a difficult position of choosing between effective virus protection and reduced comfort, convenience and productivity, along with added costs.\n\nMasks have been standard at construction jobsites since the pandemic's spread was recognized and because social distancing of six feet at all times is impossible. But actual working conditions are of course different from darkened enclosures under controlled conditions.\n\nThe authors did not describe how the volume of the speaker's words during the test was kept constant but did acknowledge that their testing method isn't the same as measuring droplet scatter in an actual work setting.\n\nOne concern this summer has been heat. Last month, Matthew Eleazer, president of bricklayers union Local 1, based in Oregon and Washington, said his union and its signatory contractors distributed buffs to union members who perform strenuous work. The masons valued the ability to pull the fabric down while it remained around their necks, allowing a chance to cool off faces.\n\nOther construction employers now recognize that counting on workers to bring their own face covering may not be enough. Earlier this month, Mecklenburg County, N.C., business leaders and government officials started distributing 100,000 face coverings intended to reduce the amount of infection spread among some groups of construction trades workers after positive cases surfaced on projects.\n\nThe free masks provided appeared to be variations of the multi-layered, cotton-style types, which scored in the droplet spread study's middle range. Those types were more effective than the buff, according toe the Duke researchers, but less effective than the more-costly N95 masks used to prevent respiratory damage when dust particles are airborne.\n\nThis article was updated August 18 to include the input from the study authors and to emphasize that their test of the face-covering fleece (also known as buffs or gaiters) was of a lightweight polyester and spandex variety only."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/katu.com\/news\/local\/oregons-coronavirus-outbreaks-surpass-20-as-statewide-infections-near-20000","domain":"katu.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 21:19:00","title":"Oregon's coronavirus outbreaks surpass 20 as statewide infections near 20,000","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/katu.com\/resources\/media2\/16x9\/full\/1015\/center\/80\/f1bb5ad4-c247-4ddd-9bad-760ca9147a81-large16x9_GettyImages1215713130.jpg","content":"PORTLAND, Ore. \u2013 Health officials in Oregon reported 299 new cases of coronavirus on Wednesday, bringing the state\u2019s total to 19,979 since the pandemic began.\n\nA majority of those new cases were reported in Multnomah (59) Washington (48) and Marion (42) counties.\n\nThe latest report from the Oregon Health Authority also found 69 active outbreaks at workplaces across the state, including three news ones at a Walmart in Umatilla County, the OR1 Construction site in Multnomah County, and Lamb Weston facilities in Boardman, Oregon.

It all depends on the other measures and the level of TTI coverage.\n\n\"Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it's about 50% coverage.\"\n\nHe added: \"The most recent data [shows] about 81% of positives are interviewed, about 81% of those report contacts and about 75% of those contacts are reached, so overall that equates to coverage of 50%.\n\n\"It looks from the ONS data like there are about 4,200 new infections per day.

In a paper published to Biofabrication, the researchers from Beijing\u2019s Tsinghua University said they have taken the first steps towards a new potential way of treating gastric wounds by using a microrobot.\n\nThe microrobot would be combined with another new concept called \u2018in-situ in-vivo bioprinting\u2019, whereby the robot would be placed into the body to treat gastric wounds. The robot would print healthy cells that could be applied directly to the wound site to repair the tissue.\n\nThe paper\u2019s co-author, Prof Tao Xu, said that injuries to the gastric wall are a common problem in the digestive tract, with about 12pc of the world\u2019s population experiencing such an injury to varying degrees.\n\n\u201cThe difficulty is that current bioprinting technology focuses on external sites,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBioprinters are normally quite large, and cannot be applied to inner tissue repair without invasive surgery to give enough room for the printing operation. To overcome this, we developed a microrobot that enters the body via an endoscope to carry out tissue repair inside the body.\u201d\n\nFolds for easier entry\n\nThe microrobot was developed from a \u2018delta robot\u2019 and is composed of a fixed base, moving platform and three identical kinematic chains. To be as minimally invasive as possible, it can fold itself down when entering the patients\u2019 body, then unfold before beginning the bioprinting operation.\n\nPhD student Wenxiang Zhao said the concept was tested in two different ways, the first of which used a model of a human stomach and mimicked the robot\u2019s insertion process, with help from an endoscope, and the printing process.\n\n\u201cSecond, we carried out a bioprinting test in a cell culture dish to test how effective the device was at bioprinting viable cells and repairing wounds,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth tests showed promising results. A 10-day cell culture showed that printed cells remained at a high viability and a steady proliferation, which indicated good biological function of the cells in printed tissue scaffolds.\u201d\n\nXu said that this study has helped verify the concept as being feasible, but more work needs to be done to bring it to full realisation.

THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the psychoactive substance within marijuana that creates a \u201chigh.\u201d\n\nTetrahydrocannabinol can also cause a faster heart rate, increase the heart\u2019s need for oxygen, disrupt the walls of arteries and contribute to higher blood pressure while prone, according to other studies.\n\n\u201cCannabis smoke contains components similar to tobacco smoke,\u201d Page said, and studies show tobacco-like increases in carbon monoxide and tar in a weed smoker\u2019s blood after smoking marijuana, regardless of the THC content.\n\nChest pain, heart attacks, heart rhythm disturbances and other serious heart conditions are associated with both tobacco and marijuana carbon monoxide intoxication, the statement said.\n\nFor anyone with existing heart disease, risks go up. Smoking weed has triggered heart attacks, a higher risk of strokes and heart failure in people with underlying heart disease, studies show.\n\nIn comparison, CBD, or cannabidiol, one of the other 80 chemicals in cannabis, does not give the \u201chigh\u201d typically associated with THC. Nor does it appear to cause harm to the heart.\n\nIn fact, studies reviewed by the medical group showed possible links to lower blood pressure, reduced heart rate and less inflammation, which is an underlying culprit of the narrowing of the arteries that can lead to heart disease and strokes.\n\nHowever, despite the hundreds of products currently being sold over the counter and online, there is only one CBD-derived product approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, the group wrote.\n\n\u2018Urgent\u2019 need for in-depth research\n\nThere is one caveat to all these research findings: Existing studies on marijuana and the heart are \u201cshort-term, observational and retrospective studies, which identify trends but do not prove cause and effect,\u201d Page said.\n\nThere is an \u201curgent\u201d need for \u201ccarefully designed, prospective short- and long-term studies regarding cannabis use and cardiovascular safety,\u201d Page added.\n\nBut that\u2019s tough to do in today\u2019s climate, because marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance by the US Drug Enforcement Agency. That limits research dramatically, and the DEA should remove those restrictions so that scientists can better study marijuana\u2019s effects, the group advised.\n\nIn addition, the medical group recommended cannabis to be part of the US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s tobacco control and prevention efforts, which may mean that there would be age restrictions on who can purchase weed, retailer regulations and even excise taxes.\n\nThe American Heart Association is looking over the scientific statement and will be releasing new policy updates in coming weeks, according to Michelle Kirkwood, an AHA spokesperson.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\u201cThe public needs fact-based, valid scientific information about cannabis\u2019s effect on the heart and blood vessels,\u201d Page said.\n\n\u201cResearch funding at federal and state levels must be increased to match the expansion of cannabis use \u2013 to clarify the potential therapeutic properties and to help us better understand the cardiovascular and public health implications of frequent cannabis use.\u201d"},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.kcra.com\/article\/another-el-dorado-county-eaterys-permit-pulled-covid-19-violations\/33586997","domain":"kcra.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 18:25:00","title":"Another El Dorado County eatery's permit pulled over COVID-19 violations","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/kubrick.htvapps.com\/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com\/htv_default_image\/kcra\/logo.png","content":"A third eatery in El Dorado County had its health permit revoked after defying the state's health order to not operate indoors, officials said.Danette's Brick Oven Pub on Lawyer Drive in Placerville was directed to close Wednesday because of noncompliance with the state health order as well as failure to comply with mask requirements and for not adhering to the required COVID-19 worksite-specific prevention plan, according to the county.The restaurant will be allowed to reopen \"once it has been reinspected and the violations have been abated,\" Carla Hass, county spokesperson, said in a statement.Apple Bistro and Cafe El Dorado also had their health permits revoked by El Dorado County.\n\nA third eatery in El Dorado County had its health permit revoked after defying the state's health order to not operate indoors, officials said.\n\nDanette's Brick Oven Pub on Lawyer Drive in Placerville was directed to close Wednesday because of noncompliance with the state health order as well as failure to comply with mask requirements and for not adhering to the required COVID-19 worksite-specific prevention plan, according to the county.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe restaurant will be allowed to reopen \"once it has been reinspected and the violations have been abated,\" Carla Hass, county spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nApple Bistro and Cafe El Dorado also had their health permits revoked by El Dorado County."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.midlands103.com\/news\/midlands-news\/coronavirus-national-news-saturday-15th-august-2020\/","domain":"midlands103.com","published_date":"2020-08-14 23:04:08","title":"Coronavirus: CMO Warns Numbers Rising Across The Country","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/mmo.aiircdn.com\/277\/644927359c8e7.jpg","content":"National news updates on Saturday 15th August.\n\nLatest figures:\n\nThere have been no new deaths reported to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre today.\n\nThere has now been a total of 1,774 COVID-19 related deaths in Ireland.\n\nAs of midnight Friday 14th August, the HPSC has been notified of 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

At this time, anosmia was not yet listed as an official symptom and covid-19 testing among NHS workers was still limited to those displaying symptoms of a new continuous cough and\/or a high temperature (>37.8\u00b0C) as per national guidance.\n\nNevertheless, 73 (27.9 per cent) of the participants had been tested for Covid-19, with 56 of these (76.7 per cent) confirmed positive.\n\nIn line with Public Health England guidance at the time of the study, staff who only had anosmia as a symptom would not have been required to isolate or be eligible for testing. Like other trusts, staff testing for Covid-19 at Barts Health has been available since late March 2020. Loss of smell was included as a symptom in national guidance since May 18 2020 and any staff with that symptom are required to have a test and self-isolate for seven days.\n\nProf Philpot said: \u201cThe really interesting thing that we found was that 168 of the participants \u2013 nearly two thirds \u2013 said that they had lost their sense of smell or taste at some point between mid-February and mid-April.\n\n\u201cWe also found a strong association between smell loss and the positive Covid-19 test results, with those who had lost their sense of smell being almost five times more likely to test positive.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that a large proportion of healthcare workers may have already been infected with Covid-19, with only mild symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe conducted this research at Barts Health, however we would expect to see similar results from other NHS trusts too.\n\n\u201cCases like this most likely went undiagnosed at the time because of a lack of awareness about smell loss as a symptom.\n\n\u201cThis is really important because healthcare professionals are at the frontline of the pandemic and are at high risk of both contracting and spreading coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for awareness and early recognition of anosmia as a means to identify, urgently test and isolate affected healthcare workers in order to prevent further spread of disease,\u201d he added.\n\nRupert Pearse, clinical director for research and development at Barts Health NHS Trust said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted to play a central role in supporting key research studies which help us better understand Covid-19. We know that NHS trusts that carry out research deliver better quality patient care and we are one of the leading contributors to clinical research across the NHS.\n\n\u201cOur staff have also volunteered to participate in a variety of important projects too and we are pleased to be able to support studies that focus on our healthcare workers.\u201d\n\nThe study also involved a follow-up survey in May, in which 47 per cent of respondents reported that their sense of smell and taste had completely recovered. A further 42 per cent said they had partially recovered their sense of smell and taste, but just over 7 per cent still suffered anosmia.\n\nThe survey has also been running in two Norfolk hospitals and in two hospitals in the North West with the responses of over 1,000 healthcare workers due to be published soon."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.independent.ie\/irish-news\/department-of-health-reports-200-new-cases-of-covid-19-in-ireland-39452437.html","domain":"independent.ie","published_date":"2020-08-15 17:44:00","title":"Department of Health reports 200 new cases of Covid-19 in Ireland","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/focus.independent.ie\/thumbor\/BF1G2ixRL7NCPNNoK4PqzRbqRwY=\/0x305:5316x3237\/960x640\/prod-mh-ireland\/c839d8fc-c3b1-11ed-a50b-0210609a3fe2","content":"Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the statistics were deeply concerning (Niall Carson\/PA)\n\nThere have been another 200 reported cases of Covid-19 in Ireland according to figures released this evening, with almost half of the new cases in lockdown counties.\n\nThis represents the largest daily increase in confirmed cases of the virus since the beginning of May.\n\nThere have been no new reported deaths, according to figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.\n\nKildare has 81 new cases of the virus.

Some employers have failed to provide adequate paid leave, if any, so employees felt they had to return to work \u2013 even while possibly infectious.\n\nMany hospitals with an onslaught of patients have found themselves short-staffed. That need dovetailed with an entrenched culture in medicine of \u201cpresenteeism\u201d. Frontline healthcare workers, in particular, follow a brutal ethos of being tough enough to work even when ill, reasoning that other \u201cpeople are sicker\u201d, said Andra Blomkalns, the chair of Stanford University\u2019s emergency medicine department.\n\nIn a survey of nearly 1,200 members, the Health Professionals and Allied Employees Union found roughly a third of those who said they had gotten sick reported returning to work with symptoms.\n\nHospital employees are not only forced to choose between their paychecks and their health, they also go back to work knowing they may infect patients or colleagues. An investigation by KHN and the Guardian has identified at least 922 frontline health workers who have died of Covid-19, probably exposed to the virus at work.\n\nThe dilemma strains health workers\u2019 sense of professional responsibility, knowing they may become vectors spreading infectious diseases to the patients they are meant to heal.\n\nA database of Covid-related complaints made to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration this spring hints at the scope of the problem. It includes a respiratory clinic in North Carolina where Covid-positive employees were told they would be fired if they stayed home and a veterans hospital in Massachusetts where employees were returning to work sick because they weren\u2019t paid otherwise.\n\n\u201cWhat we learned in this pandemic was employees felt disposable,\u201d said Debbie White, a registered nurse and the president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees Union. \u201cEmployers didn\u2019t protect them, and they felt like a commodity.\u201d\n\nView image in fullscreen Nurses protest to highlight practices during the coronavirus disease pandemic at St Petersburg general hospital in Florida. Photograph: Octavio Jones\/Reuters\n\nThe nurse from Hackensack Meridian, the largest hospital chain in New Jersey, told the hospital that a doctor had instructed her to stay home. Her supervisors did not threaten to fire her, she said.\n\nBut in daily calls from work, she was reminded her colleagues were short-staffed and \u201csuffering\u201d.\n\nShe also discovered her employer had conducted what it called a \u201cpayroll adjustment\u201d in March, taking leave from many of its employees without explaining its calculations. (A hospital spokesperson said the adjustment corrected a technical problem, adding that workers were informed of the changes and denying anyone was \u201cshorted any PTO that they rightfully earned\u201d.)\n\nThe health system followed CDC recommendations in clearing workers who contract Covid-19 to return to work, it said.\n\nFederal officials acknowledge that staffing shortages may require sick healthcare workers to return to work before recovering.\n\nWhen all other options are exhausted, the CDC website says, workers who are suspected or confirmed to have Covid-19 (and \u201cwho are well enough to work\u201d) may be allowed to treat patients who are not severely immunocompromised \u2013 first those who are also confirmed to have Covid-19, then those with suspected cases.\n\n\u201cAs a last resort,\u201d the website says, Covid-positive workers may provide care to patients who do not have the virus.\n\nMeanwhile immunocompromised workers at high risk from the virus have faced difficult choices, said Liz Stokes, the director of the American Nurses Association\u2019s Center for Ethics and Human Rights.\n\nShe recounted the experience of a surgical nurse with Crohn\u2019s disease who took leave at her doctor\u2019s recommendation but was pressured by her bosses and co-workers to return.\n\n\u201cShe really expressed severe guilt because she felt like she was abandoning her duties as a nurse,\u201d she said. \u201cShe felt like she was abandoning her colleagues, her patients.\u201d\n\nMoney pressures are also a factor. Shenetta White-Ballard carried an oxygen canister in a backpack at work. A nurse at Legacy Nursing and Rehabilitation of Port Allen in Louisiana, she needed the help to breathe after a serious respiratory infection.\n\nWhen Covid-19 appeared, she showed up for work. Her husband, Eddie Ballard, said his paycheck from Walmart was not enough to support their family.\n\n\u201cShe kept bringing up, she gotta pay the bills,\u201d he said.\n\nShe died on 1 May at age 44.\n\nLegacy Nursing and Rehabilitation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nResidents, or doctors in training, are among the most vulnerable, working on inflexible, tightly packed schedules often caring for dozens of patients each day.\n\nNot long after New York-Presbyterian hospital admitted one of the city\u2019s first confirmed Covid-19 patients, Lauren Schleimer, a first-year surgical resident, reported a sore throat and a cough. Because she had not been exposed to that patient, she was told she could keep working and to wear a mask if she was coughing.\n\nHer symptoms subsided. But weeks later, her symptoms returned, worse than before. The hospital instructed her to stay home for seven days. She was never tested.\n\nA hospital spokesperson said it was heeding state and federal guidance to protect frontline workers.\n\nSchleimer returned to work symptom-free at the end of her quarantine, caring for patients fighting the same virus she suspects she had. While she never felt that sick, she worried she could infect someone else.\n\n\u201cThis was not the kind of thing I would stay home for,\u201d Schleimer said. \u201cBut I definitely had some symptoms, and I was just trying to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nKHN is a non-profit news service covering health issues.

It is the fifth day in a row that no new fatalities have been reported.\n\nThe total number of deaths remains at 1,763, with a total of 26,253 coronavirus cases.\n\n35 of the 45 cases notified today are among men, with the remainder among women. 77% of those infected are aged under 45.\n\n31 of the new cases are associated with outbreaks or are close contacts of a confirmed case, while four cases have been identified as community transmission.\n\n33 of the infections are in Kildare, seven in Dublin, and five are spread across four other counties.\n\nThe Minister said things had got progressively and steadily worse in this country in the last week or so.\n\nWhat was really worrying public health officials, he said, was the rise in the number of community transmissions - where someone tests positive for the virus, but neither they nor public health officials know where they got it from.\n\nMr Donnelly said the total number of community transmissions had gone up in the last two weeks, and that there was community transmission in many counties across the country.\n\nThe Minister said putting different restrictions in place in different parts of the country, was something they could look at in the future. However, he said it was not safe to do so at the moment because community transmission was happening right across the country.\n\nHe was speaking after the Taoiseach confirmed that the reopening of pubs, hotel bars and nightclubs will now not go ahead on 10 August as planned.\n\nMeanwhile, there has been a significant Covid-19 outbreak among employees of the Kildare Chilling Company.\n\nThe company has not confirmed the number of cases but says it is working closely with the Health Service Executive.\n\nSeven workers at a food processing plant in Co Offaly have tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe business affected is Carroll Cuisine in Tullamore, which has carried out what it described as a scheduled shut down and a deep clean of the premises.\n\nIt has since reopened and gone back into production.\n\nIt is understood a worker informed the company that they had tested positive for the coronavirus last week.\n\nTesting of all employees is taking place and six other staff members, who worked with the initial colleague affected, have so far tested positive.\n\nCarroll Cuisine employs 330 people.\n\nThe company said those affected are now self-isolating and no other positive cases have been identified.\n\nLatest coronavirus stories\n\nThe World Health Organization's top emergency expert said people can sustain a new normal if they follow the public health guidelines on Covid-19, but warned that great care is needed over the coming months until a safe and effective vaccine can be found.\n\nDr Mike Ryan said there are around 139 coronavirus vaccine candidates currently in some form of clinical evaluation; 26 are in full blown trials, while six are in phase three trials (population level trials where the vaccine is tested on ordinary people), which he described as an incredible achievement.\n\nHowever, he cautioned that people need to be patient because the vaccines must be safe and effective and a vaccine \"may not be the silver bullet\" in controlling the virus.\n\nHe said a lot of the Covid-19 reduction measures - such as social distancing and hand hygiene - should also result in a much lower influenza season, but no one can say this with certainty.\n\nSpeaking on RT\u00c9's Today with Sarah McInerney, Dr Ryan said Ireland's health system stood up to the Covid-19 test well and is confident it will continue to do so, but he added that controlling community transmission is the best way to keep the pressure off the hospitals.\n\nHe said he understands that people are tired and everyone wants to get back to work and to a normal life, but to achieve this we need to reach a point where small flare ups can be picked up quickly before they spread to the whole community.\n\nDr Ryan said pre-testing for Covid-19 before travelling abroad can help, but it is \"not a panacea\" and must be taken as part of a broad, multi-faceted strategy.\n\nHe also said that pubs are not the cause of spreading Covid-19 as such, but poorly ventilated, crowded areas where people might let down their guard are not ideal and warned that large parties can spark outbreaks and must be managed.\n\nHe said that while young people are less likely to suffer severe reactions to Covid-19, the long-term effects of even mild or moderate cases are unknown.\n\nThe WHO says data to date suggests 80% of Covid-19 infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen, and 5% are critical, requiring ventilation.\n\nGenerally, you need to be 15 minutes or more in the vicinity of an infected person and within two metres of them, to be considered at-risk, or a close contact."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/life-style\/health\/1321786\/high-blood-pressure-protein-hypertension-lower-diet","domain":"express.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-12 10:41:00","title":"High blood pressure: Increase your intake of this food to lower hypertension","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.images.express.co.uk\/img\/dynamic\/11\/590x\/high-protein-1321786.jpg?r=1597225233859","content":"High cholesterol: Sprinkle this fruit on your breakfast to lower LDL\n\nHow?

Their only physical contact is if Trary walks in with her back toward Grandma. Then Robinson will kiss her own hand and lightly touch Trary\u2019s back \u2014 \u201clike I\u2019m sending her a kiss with my hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWe live together, but we live apart.\u201d\n\nNot hugging Grandma is hard for Trary, too: \u201cIt\u2019s like I can\u2019t see her anymore.\u201d\n\nThe separation Trary and her grandmother experience in their home is becoming a bigger issue as children go back to school. Many public schools nationwide are starting remotely in the fall, but if classes resume in person later this year, the chasm could grow between generations who live together.\n\nMillions of seniors 65 and up, one of the populations most vulnerable to the virus, live with a school-age child. For those households, the new school year means reconsidering interactions from family dinner to bedtime hugs.\n\nWhile studies so far suggest children are less likely to become infected with COVID-19 or only experience mild symptoms, data isn\u2019t conclusive on whether infected kids easily spread the disease. In a Georgia school district that has reopened classrooms, possible exposure has forced more than 1,200 students and staff into quarantine and two high schools to close.\n\nIf a grandchild does bring the virus home, grandparents of colour are at higher risk than their white counterparts, experts say.\n\nAs of 2018, the U.S. had 51 million seniors, with 3.3 million, or 6%, living with at least one child between 5 and 18, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study. The situation is far more prevalent among communities of colour: 19% of Asian and Pacific Islander seniors live with a school-age child, 17% of Hispanics, 13% of American Indian or Alaska Natives, and 11% of Black people. Just 4% of older whites live with a school-age child.\n\n\u201cI think there hasn\u2019t been a lot of attention to the ripple effects on older people who may live in the same household,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, one of the report\u2019s authors.\n\nPeople of colour are already at greater risk from the virus because they\u2019re more likely to be essential workers who can\u2019t work from home, among other factors, Neuman said. They more often live in multigenerational households because of cultural norms, sharing expenses or getting help with child care.\n\nThat could become more prevalent as COVID-19 clobbers the U.S. economy. Living with extended family increased during the Great Recession in 2009, according to Jaia Peterson, deputy executive director of Generations United, an advocacy group focused on intergenerational issues.\n\nMalia Letalu lives in a three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Santa Clara, California, with her husband, four children \u2014 ages 9, 5, 2 and 3 months \u2014 and her mother and stepfather. Letalu, who is Samoan and Filipino, decided to live with her parents a few years ago so she could help if they got sick. They\u2019re in their mid-60s and have several health conditions between them, including diabetes and heart disease.\n\nBut Letalu won\u2019t separate them from her oldest kids if school transitions to both remote and in-person learning later this year.\n\n\u201cI guess you could say it\u2019s for emotional reasons,\u201d Letalu said. \u201cIf there really was a possibility of exposure at the school \u2026 then I would definitely social distance them and quarantine them inside. I would also take us all to go get tested.\u201d\n\nYoma Villalobos, whose parents live with her in Phoenix, worries about big changes at home if the virtual lessons for her 12-year-old and 9-year-old sons at the start of the school year become a mix of in-person classes.\n\nIf that happens, she will have them shower and change clothes when they get home from school. The boys hate wearing masks, but Villalobos thinks they might use them if it meant protecting their grandparents, who they kiss and hug each morning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re such a close family. For us, eating together is our thing,\u201d said Villalobos, who\u2019s Latina. \u201cIf we were to change our dynamic, that changes the whole family.\u201d\n\nBeing in the same house can make it tempting to bend the rules on social distancing or wearing masks. Peterson of Generations United advises families to agree on what rules to stick to and find unique ways to connect.\n\n\u201cI also believe when something happens, and families get creative \u2026 those can be some of the strongest memories for children and positive memories,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nGrandparents who are primary caregivers potentially face a more dire situation. Chris Svaldi, 71, helped raise her 8-year-old grandson and got permanent custody of him two years ago. He will return to his private Catholic school in Montrose, Colorado, on Aug. 24, with fewer than 10 students so they can practice social distancing, Svaldi said. Still, she\u2019s pushing COVID-19 worries to the back of her mind.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t allow myself to go there because if I do, I struggle a little bit with anxiety,\u201d said Svaldi, who\u2019s white. \u201cIt would affect the way I raise him, and I don\u2019t want him to be a kid who\u2019s afraid of everything.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s crucial for \u201cgrandfamilies\u201d like Svaldi\u2019s to be prepared for the worst, whether it\u2019s COVID-19 or some other calamity, Peterson said. With grandparents raising grandchildren, there can be legal matters at stake, too. They may be the last option before foster care. Plus, COVID-19 is probably already on children\u2019s minds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to be open about it so that children have a chance to ask questions and know there\u2019s a plan, versus if there\u2019s any hesitancy to talk about it because they don\u2019t want to bring it up,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nRobinson, the grandmother in Phoenix who\u2019s Latina, reminds herself that being separated from her granddaughter by doors or walls is better than being separated by a hospital.\n\n\u201cI would never want my loved ones to be in that situation,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI\u2019d rather just listen to her laugh out there than having to go through something like that.\u201d\n\n___ Terry Tang is a member of The Associated Press Race and Ethnicity team.

Eating fish and rice cakes or more commonly chicken and broccoli, meal after meal, means nothing if it gets you that elusive ultra low body fat. One thing we didn't anticipate, however, is that bodybuilders often go so far as to include breastmilk \u2013 yes, you read that right \u2013 into their diet plans.\n\nA new Netflix documentary series, (Un)Well, is putting bodybuilders who drink breastmilk under the spotlight and asking men, including amateur bodybuilder James \u201cJJ\u201d Ritenour, the question: is it ethical to buy human milk and use it for something that it so far removed from its original purpose? \u201cBreastmilk did well for me in the past,\u201d says Ritenour in the documentary. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t it do the same again?\u201d\n\nWhichever side of the ethical question you fall on, the logic of bodybuilders drinking breastmilk can seem obvious, right? We know the benefits it provides to the growth of a baby, spanning from gut maturity to brain development, and it isn\u2019t called \u201cliquid gold\u201d for no good reason. But do these benefits really extend to bodybuilders?\n\n\u201cI think the idea behind drinking breast milk for muscle growth is that it\u2019s incredibly calorie and nutrient dense, and it has some additional healthy substances,\u201d said Brian St. Pierre, a sports dietitian with Precision Nutrition, to Men\u2019s Health US. \u201cBreast milk is designed to rapidly grow a human baby, so maybe people think a similar effect will happen to fully grown humans?\u201d\n\nThe calorific benefits of breastmilk varies from mother to mother and depends on how they live their life; it\u2019s ultimately only as good as the diet and general health of the person who produces it. When researchers analysed more than twenty studies of breast milk composition they found that 100ml contained:\n\n65 calories (16 more than semi-skimmed cow\u2019s milk)\n\n6.7g carbohydrates\n\n3.8g fat\n\n1.3g protein (2.1g less than semi-skimmed cow\u2019s milk)*\n\n(*via NCBI)\n\n\u201cIf the woman has a terrible diet the breast milk will be terrible quality,\u201d said Marc Halpern, a registered dietitian based in Salt Lake City. \u201cAnd diseases like HIV can be transmitted through breast milk.\u201d\n\nEven worse, because you can\u2019t go to your local Tesco to buy a carton of breastmilk, bodybuilders buy it from mothers who pump it in their homes, rather than controlled, sterile environments.\n\nBy the time the milk reaches the bodybuilder it can be contaminated, which is what was found to be happening during a study conducted by Nationwide Children's Hospital who found that out of 101 samples of breast milk purchased online, 10% of them were \"topped off\" with cow's milk or baby formula. In addition, 75% of the samples had pathogenic or disease-causing bacteria\/viruses in it, adding more risk to infants who suffer from pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised so many samples had such high bacterial counts and even fecal contamination in the milk, most likely from poor hand hygiene. We were also surprised a few samples contained salmonella,\u201d said Sarah A. Keim, PhD, principal investigator in the Center for Biobehavioral Health at Nationwide Children's Hospital. \u201cOther harmful bacteria may have come from the use of either unclean containers or unsanitary breast milk pump parts.\u201d\n\nRelated Story This 74-Year-Old's Transformation Went Viral\n\nSo should you opt for breastmilk if you\u2019re a bodybuilder? It's probably safer to stick to cow or nut milk for now.\n\n\u201cCould breast milk help you build more muscle? I don\u2019t think anyone knows, and it\u2019s never been studied, but all you\u2019re going on is very rare anecdotes from online forums,\u201d said St. Pierre. \u201cIs it possible? Of course.

The results of the phase I\/II clinical trials were published in Nature on August 12.\n\nRNA vaccine platforms that use messenger RNA to elicit immune responses have enabled rapid vaccine development in response to the pandemic. RNA vaccines provide flexibility in the design and expression of vaccine antigens that can mimic antigen structures and expression during natural infection. Moreover, they are considered safe because RNA is only transiently expressed and metabolized, and subsequently eliminated by natural mechanisms.\n\nThe BNT162b1 vaccine candidate, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, incorporates nucleoside-modified RNA and encodes the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a key target of virus-neutralizing antibodies. The RBD antigen expressed by the vaccine candidate is modified by the addition of T4 fibritin-derived foldon trimerization domain that increases its immunogenicity. The vaccine RNA is formulated in lipid nanoparticles for efficient delivery into cells after intramuscular injection.\n\nIn the phase I\/II trial, between May 4 and June 19, 45 healthy adults were randomly vaccinated with either 10 \u00b5g, 30 \u00b5g, or 100 \u00b5g of BNT162b1 or placebo. Participants at the 10- and 30-\u00b5g levels also received a second dose of the vaccine after 21 days.\n\nThe researchers found that the vaccine candidate was generally well-tolerated and safe, with only mild side effects that increased with dose level in the seven days after vaccination.\n\nTo determine immunogenicity, the researchers determined RBD-binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations and SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing titers at baseline (before vaccination), at seven and 21 days after the first dose, and at seven and 14 days after the second dose of the BNT162b1.\n\nBy 21 days after the first dose of the vaccine, the concentrations of IgG for all dose levels was greater than that found in convalescent serum from recovered patients. For those participants who received a second dose, there was a significant increase in RBD-binding antibodies, with the 30-\u00b5g group displaying much stronger immune responses than the 10-\u00b5g group.\n\nFor these groups, the antibody response was eightfold stronger at 10 \u00b5g and 50-fold stronger at 30 \u00b5g than that found in convalescent serum. Those who received a single dose at 100 \u00b5g did not see increases in antibodies beyond 21 days after vaccination.\n\nThe authors attributed the higher RBD-binding IgG response by the vaccine relative to convalescent serum to the RNA vaccine design, which has exposed epitopes on the RNA-expressed RBD immunogen.\n\nFor all dose levels, small increases in neutralizing antibodies were observed after 21 days of initial vaccination. Again, a second vaccine dose (at both the 10- and 30-\u00b5g levels) produced significantly greater serum neutralizing antibodies after both seven and 14 days. These responses were 1.9-fold at 10 \u00b5g and 4.6-fold at 30 \u00b5g higher compared to convalescent serum.\n\nComparing vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers to those from the sera of convalescent humans provides a benchmark to track the magnitude of vaccine-elicited responses and the vaccine's ability to provide protection.\n\nThe researchers noted that efficacy of the vaccine will be determined in an upcoming phase III trial. A related vaccine that encodes the full-length spike immunogen is also being tested in a parallel trial in Germany, which is assessing additional immune responses, including neutralizing responses against variant strains and cell-mediated responses.\n\nDo you have a unique perspective on your research related to vaccine development or infectious diseases?

(The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list of vaccine schedules can be found here.)\n\nThe only reason we have herd immunity against so many diseases is because upwards of 90% to 95% of children are vaccinated, Casler said, but no one will be presumed safe once the country drops below that level.\n\n\"Families have been on the path to have fewer and fewer vaccinations of children, but during this crisis ... the amount of vaccinations have been plummeting,\" said Dr. Rahul Gupta, chief medical officer at the March of Dimes and former health commissioner of West Virginia. \"There's no doubt that there will be a resurgence of other diseases.\"\n\nThough it\u2019s not certain if the new school year will bring about a new outbreak, doctors say it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibilities.\n\nBefore measles, Savoy said, she's most worried about influenza. As more schools push back start dates, parents feel less pressure to vaccinate their children for the flu.\n\n\"That makes me incredibly nervous because influenza kills more children than we give it credit for,\" she said. \"We forget how deadly influenza can be for children.\"\n\nAll 50 states have legislation requiring specific vaccines for students, but 45 states and Washington, D.C., grant religious exemptions, according to the National Conference of States Legislatures. Fifteen states allow philosophical exemptions for those who object to immunizations because of personal, moral or other beliefs.\n\n\u201cAny person who is at a child care or school setting \u2026 having their vaccinations up to date is essential,\u201d Burkhardt said. \u201c(It\u2019s) important for those who are in schools, but important for anyone because it could be a community spread as well.\u201d\n\nExperts urge parents who have missed their child's scheduled vaccinations to call their doctor and set up a plan to catch up.\n\nSavoy says it's never too late for a child to get vaccinated and they most likely don't need to restart a vaccine series if they've already gotten the first dose. She advises parents who are nervous about COVID-19 to schedule a telemedicine appointment first so the trip to the doctor's office can be quick and easy.\n\n\"We worked so hard to eradicate (measles), it would be a shame to go back the other way,\" she said.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

A new study has uncovered deviations and lapses in the immune system that appear to spell the difference between severe and mild cases of Covid-19. The difference, the study suggests, may stem from how our evolutionarily ancient innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that cases Covid-19. The innate immune system rapidly senses pathogens, and immediately launches a somewhat indiscriminate attack on them. It also mobilises precisely targeted, but slower \u201csharp-shooter\u201d cells from the adaptive immune system (which is different from the innate immune system).\n\nAccording to the scientists, this finding is particularly important since it helps explain Ebselen\u2019s potential efficacy as a repurposed drug, and reveals a new vulnerability in the virus that was previously not known and that could be useful in developing new therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.\n\nA medical worker, left, performs a COVID-19 test at a test center at Vnukovo airport outside Moscow, Russia, Friday, Aug. 7, 2020.

This case will be included in tomorrow's official numbers. The school is closed for on-site learning on Monday, and cleaning and contact tracing is underway, after a student tested positive for COVID-19 late last week.\n\nThree cases reported today are linked to the funeral events in Bankstown and surrounding suburbs, bringing the total number of cases linked to this cluster to 63.\n\nFor a list of locations associated with known cases and advice on testing and isolation, see NSW Government - Latest new and updates.\n\nOf the known clusters, there are now:\n\n111 cases linked to Thai Rock Wetherill Park\n\n63 cases linked to the funeral events in Bankstown and surrounding suburbs, including 15 associated with Mounties in Mount Pritchard\n\n34 cases linked to Potts Point, including 28 cases linked to the Apollo Restaurant and six cases linked with the Thai Rock Restaurant Potts Point (two cases attended both).\n\nWhile most cases in the past week have been associated with local clusters and close contacts with known cases, not all cases have been linked to known cases, indicating that COVID-19 is circulating in the community.

There are eight COVID\u201119 patients in intensive care and six are ventilated. Eighty-five per cent of cases being treated by NSW Health are in non-acute, out-of-hospital care.\n\nTo help stop the spread of COVID-19:\n\nIf you are unwell, stay in, get tested and isolate.\n\nWash your hands regularly. Take hand sanitiser with you when you go out.\n\nKeep your distance. Leave 1.5 metres between yourself and others.\n\nWear a mask in situations where you cannot physically distance.\n\nA full list of COVID-19 testing clinics is available or people can visit their GP.\n\nIsolation is mandatory for anyone identified as a close contact (not a casual contact) of a case. Anyone directed to undertake a 14-day self-isolation period must stay in isolation for the full time, even if they test negative. Early testing may not detect an infection, and release from self-isolation based on a negative test could allow an infectious person to infect others in the community.

Italians were unprepared when the outbreak exploded in February and the country still has one of the world\u2019s highest official death tolls at 35,000.\n\nBut after a strict nationwide 10-week lockdown, vigilant tracing of new clusters and general acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing, Italy has become a model of virus containment.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they care about their health?\u201d a mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. \u201cThey need to take our precautions \u2026 They need a real lockdown.\u201d\n\nMuch of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didn\u2019t have when the first COVID-19 patients started filling intensive care units. Yet, more than four months into a sustained outbreak, the US is about to hit an astonishing milestone of five million confirmed infections, easily the highest in the world. Health officials believe the actual number is closer to 50 million, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40 percent of all cases are asymptomatic.\n\n\u201cWe Italians always saw America as a model,\u201d said Massimo Franco, columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. \u201cBut with this virus we\u2019ve discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent.\u201d\n\nItalian Health Minister Roberto Speranza hasn\u2019t shied away from criticizing the U.S., officially condemning as \u201cwrong\u201d Washington\u2019s decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and marveling personally at President Donald Trump\u2019s virus response.\n\nAfter Trump finally donned a protective mask last month, Speranza told La7 television: \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by Trump\u2019s behavior now; I\u2019m profoundly surprised by his behavior before.\u201d\n\nWith America\u2019s list-leading 160,000 dead, politicized resistance to masks and rising caseload, European nations have barred American tourists and visitors from other countries with growing cases from freely traveling to the bloc.\n\nFrance and Germany are now imposing tests on arrival for travelers from \u201cat risk\u201d countries, the US included.\n\n\u201cI am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,\u201d German Health Minister Jens Spahn said in announcing the tests last week.\n\nMistakes were made in Europe, too, from delayed lockdowns to insufficient protections for nursing home elderly and critical shortages of tests and protective equipment for medical personnel.\n\nThe virus is still raging in some Balkan countries and thousands of maskless protesters demanded an end to virus restrictions in Berlin earlier this month. Hard-hit Spain, France and Germany have seen infection rebounds with new cases topping 1,000 a day, and Italy\u2019s cases inched up over 500 on Friday. The UK is still seeing an estimated 3,700 new infections daily, and some scientists say the country\u2019s beloved pubs might have to close again if schools are to reopen in September without causing a new wave.\n\nIn the U.S., new cases run at about 54,000 a day \u2014 an immensely higher number even when taking into account its larger population. And while that\u2019s down from a peak of well over 70,000 last month, cases are rising in nearly 20 states, and deaths are climbing in most.\n\nIn contrast, at least for now Europe appears to have the virus somewhat under control.\n\n\u201cHad the medical professionals been allowed to operate in the States, you would have belatedly gotten to a point of getting to grips with this back in March,\u201d said Scott Lucas, professor of international studies at the University of Birmingham, England. \u201cBut of course, the medical and public health professionals were not allowed to proceed unchecked,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s frequent undercutting of his own experts.\n\nWhen the virus first appeared in the United States, Trump and his supporters quickly dismissed it as either a \u201choax\u201d or a virus that would quickly disappear once warmer weather arrived. At one point, Trump suggested that ultraviolet light or injecting disinfectants would eradicate the virus. (He later said he was being facetious).\n\nTrump\u2019s frequent complaints about Dr. Anthony Fauci have regularly made headlines in Europe, where the U.S. infectious diseases expert is a respected eminence grise. Italy\u2019s leading COVID-19 hospital offered Fauci a job if Trump fired him.\n\nTrump has defended the U.S. response, blaming China, where the virus was first detected, for America\u2019s problems and saying the U.S. numbers are so high because there is so much testing. Trump supporters and Americans who have refused to wear masks against all medical advice back that line.\n\n\u202a\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to fear any sickness that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Julia Ferjo, a mother of three in Alpine, Texas, who says she is \u201cvehemently\u201d against wearing a mask. \u202aFerjo, 35, teaches fitness classes in a large gym with open doors, where she doesn\u2019t allow participants to wear masks.\n\n\u202a\u201cWhen you\u2019re breathing that hard, I would pass out,\u201d she said. \u201cI do not want people just dropping like flies.\u201d\n\nAnd health officials watched with alarm as thousands of bikers gathered Friday in the small South Dakota city of Sturgis for a 10-day motorcycle rally. The state has no mask mandates and many bikers expressed defiance of measures meant to prevent the virus\u2019s spread.\n\nDr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who is leading a team seeking treatments for COVID-19, decried such behavior, as well as the country\u2019s handling of the virus.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no national strategy, no national leadership and there\u2019s no urging for the public to act in unison and carry out the measures together,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it takes and we have completely abandoned that as a nation.\u201d\n\nWhen he gets on Zoom calls with counterparts from around the globe, \u201cEveryone cannot believe what they\u2019re seeing in the U.S. and they cannot believe the words coming out of the leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nEven the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has taken the unusual step of criticizing the U.S. when she urged Washington to reconsider its decision to break ties with the WHO. She also issued veiled criticism of U.S. efforts to buy up stocks of any vaccine that might prove effective, vowing the EU will work to provide access to everyone \u201cirrespective of where they live.\u201d\n\nMany Europeans point proudly to their national health care systems that not only test but treat COVID-19 for free, unlike the American system where the virus crisis has only exacerbated income and racial inequalities in accessing health care.\n\n\u201cThe coronavirus has brutally stripped bare the vulnerability of a country that has been sliding for years,\u201d wrote Italian author Massimo Gaggi in his new book \u201cCrack America\u201d (Broken America) about US problems that long predated COVID.\n\nGaggi said he started writing the book last year and thought then that the title would be taken as a provocative wake-up call. Then the virus hit.\n\n\u201cBy March the title wasn\u2019t a provocation any longer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was obvious.\u201d\n\n___\n\nPane reported from Boise, Idaho.

Miller\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced the start of two clinical trials for a potential coronavirus treatment called monoclonal antibodies.\n\nTwo treatments \u2014 remdesivir and dexamethasone \u2014 have been shown to help severely ill COVID-19 patients, but this would be the first potential drug to help patients early in the disease.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re dealing with now is trying to determine what works in early disease,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a press briefing Tuesday.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are made in a lab to mimic the body\u2019s natural antibodies. Antibodies act by recognizing specific pathogens \u2014 in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 \u2014 and harnessing the immune system to fight them off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NIH trials will use a monoclonal antibody developed by Eli Lilly, called LY-CoV555. This antibody was isolated from a COVID-19 patient in Washington state in the early months of the pandemic, Fauci said. It works by binding to the virus\u2019s infamous spike protein, interfering with its ability to infect cells.\n\nGigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that there are good reasons to be optimistic about monoclonal antibodies. Early data from Regeneron, another drugmaker working on monoclonal antibodies, found that the drug was effective in both treating and preventing infection in animals. Those findings were published Monday on the preprint server bioRxiv.\n\nIf monoclonal antibodies are shown to work as a treatment in the clinical trials, that would give a lot of promise for their use as a preventive medicine, as well \u2014 one that would likely be available before a vaccine, Gronvall, who is not involved with either drug trial, said.\n\nThe clinical trials are part of the NIH\u2019s Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Intervention and Vaccines program, or ACTIV.\n\nOne trial, ACTIV-2, focuses on patients early in the course of the disease, who have not been hospitalized but have tested positive within seven days and have had symptoms for no more than 10 days. A total of 220 patients will be enrolled in the phase 2 stage of this trial; half of whom will receive the experimental treatment and half of whom will receive the placebo.\n\nThe goal of the trial is to determine whether the treatment reduces the duration of a patient\u2019s symptoms through 28 days, as well as if the treatment increases the proportion of patients who test negative for the virus at various points during the trial period.\n\nIf things go well, the trial will transition to phase 3, enrolling an additional 1,780 patients for a total of 2,000, Fauci said. These patients \u2014 some of whom are at high-risk for severe illness, including older individuals \u2014 will be monitored to see if the monoclonal antibody treatment reduces the risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nThe treatment is given intravenously and takes about an hour to deliver, the NIH said in a statement.\n\nThough the trial is enrolling nonhospitalized patients, it\u2019s possible that these individuals may need hospitalization later on; the trial will determine whether the treatment reduces these odds.\n\nThe second trial, ACTIV-3, will include sicker patients: those who are hospitalized with COVID-19, but do not have end-stage organ failure. Notably, these patients are not sick enough to receive drugs such as remdesivir or dexamethasone, Fauci said. Three hundred patients will initially receive treatment or placebo in the phase 2 trial, and in phase 3, another 700 will be included for a total of 1,000 patients. The goal of the ACTIV-3 trial is to determine whether patients continue to recover for 14 days at home after they are released from the hospital.Fauci said that results from the trials should be available sometime in October, and if the treatments are shown to be successful, the drug would be available to Americans \u201cpretty quickly thereafter.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr. Dan Skovronsky, chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly, said that the company is currently working on manufacturing large quantities of the drug, and will have more than 100,000 doses available by the end of the year.\n\nHowever, he noted, \u201cproduction capacity for monoclonal antibodies in general is limited in the world,\u201d and the 100,000 doses is \u201cstill not enough.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Eli Lilly announced another phase 3 clinical trial with the same monoclonal antibody candidate. That trial, which will include participants who live and work in nursing homes, aims to determine whether the drug works prophylactically, to prevent coronavirus infection.-NBCNEWS\n\n\u2013 HERALD"},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.thenewsnigeria.com.ng\/2020\/08\/04\/risks-of-covid-19-infection-through-breastfeeding-negligible-who\/","domain":"thenewsnigeria.com.ng","published_date":"2020-08-04 20:19:06","title":"Risks of COVID-19 infection through breastfeeding negligible \u2014 WHO","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/thenewsnigeria.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\/2019\/04\/Nursing-mother-breastfeeding-1.jpg","content":"Dr Laurence Grummer-Strawn, Head of the organisation\u2019s Food and Nutrition Action in Health Systems unit, stated this on Tuesday, according to the United Nations.\n\nIn a report, the UN quoted Grummer-Strawn as making the statement at a news briefing on the 2020 World Breastfeeding Week where he appealed for greater support for the practice.\n\nThis year\u2019s event is coming amid warning by the WHO that lack of mother\u2019s milk is linked to 820,000 child deaths a year, costing the global economy 300 billion dollars (N114 trillion).\n\n\u201cWHO has been very clear in its recommendations to say absolute breastfeeding should continue.\n\n\u201cWe have never documented, anywhere around the world, any (COVID-19) transmission through breastmilk,\u201d Grummer-Strawn said.\n\n\n\nHe said exclusive breastfeeding for six months has many benefits for the infant and mother which far outweigh any risk from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said that the advantages included the fact that breastmilk, including milk which is expressed, provides lifesaving antibodies that protect babies against many childhood illnesses.\n\n\u201cThis is only one of the reasons why new mothers should initiate skin-to-skin contact and room-in with their babies quickly.\n\n\u201cThe risks of transmission of the COVID-19 virus from a COVID-positive mother to her baby seem to be extremely low\u201d, the WHO official said.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the conclusion followed the testing of the breastmilk of many mothers around the world in a variety of studies.\n\nGrummer-Strawn said although a few samples had the virus followup tests showed that the virus was not viable and could not be infective."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.independent.ie\/world-news\/coronavirus\/irelands-green-list-set-to-be-cut-over-spike-in-cases-39421319.html","domain":"independent.ie","published_date":"2020-08-04 01:30:00","title":"Green List set to be cut over spike in cases","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/focus.independent.ie\/thumbor\/EXiznI1EbOloeWrlAXPasp3L2PM=\/0x49:1499x876\/960x640\/prod-mh-ireland\/b916975c-c39d-11ed-b294-0210609a3fe2.jpg","content":"The Green List of countries deemed safe for non-essential travel may be reduced due to a spike in coronavirus cases across Europe.\n\nThe Cabinet will today review the list of 15 countries where people can travel without being asked to undergo two weeks of quarantine upon their return."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.mindbodygreen.com\/articles\/benefits-of-anger-according-to-psychologist","domain":"mindbodygreen.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 09:06:45","title":"Yes, Anger Has Value: A Psychologist On 3 Benefits Of Healthy Anger","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/mindbodygreen-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/c_crop,x_0,y_0,w_1200,h_800\/c_fill,g_auto,w_480,h_322,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy\/org\/n1g7a5g3nkdqfnlzz.jpg","content":"That's because anger has the ability to easily transform into hatred or ill will, which is not only unhealthy but destructive. \"As soon as we slide into ill will, vengeance, or contempt, we're in trouble.\" So even if you might be practically seething with anger, make sure it's the mobilizing, impactful kind\u2014not the kind that wishes harm on others.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nSome 40.9% of respondents reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health condition overall: 31% said they had experienced symptoms of anxiety or depression in the 30 days before taking the survey, while 26% reported trauma or stress related symptoms.Some 13% of those surveyed reported starting or increasing substance use as a coping mechanism, while overall 11% of respondents said they had seriously considered suicide.However, the pandemic appears to have had a particularly detrimental effect on people in the 18-24-year-old age group.Some 75% of young people reported having at least one adverse mental or behavioral health symptom, making them by far the most impacted demographic. Symptoms of anxiety or depression were the most commonly experienced , with 63% of 18-24 year-olds reporting anxiety related symptoms.Nearly half (46%) reported symptoms of a trauma- and stress-related disorder TSRD, while a quarter (25%) reported using substances to cope with pandemic related stress or emotions. And 25.5% of young people said they had seriously considered suicide within the 30 days before taking the survey.Unpaid caregivers were also vulnerable, with two thirds reporting at least one adverse effect, again, the most common being anxiety or depression, which had impacted 58% of caregivers. Some 31% of caregivers had considered suicide.The next most impacted demographic were those whose educational level was less than a high school diploma: 30% of people within that demographic had suicidal feelings, while 66% had experienced at least one adverse impact.Knowing someone who had died of COVID-19 appeared to have little impact on whether or not people experienced detrimental mental health impacts. Some 40.1% of those who did know someone who had died of the disease reported having experienced adverse mental health, against 41% of those who did not personally know someone who had died of COVID-19.Similarly, 13.4% of those who did not know someone who had died of the disease had experienced suicidal thoughts recently, against 11.3% of those who did know someone who had died.The findings were a significant increase on those reported for the same period in 2019: instances of anxiety disorder had nearly tripled (25.5% against 8.1% in 2019); and prevalence of depressive disorder was approximately four times that reported in 2019 (24.3% versus 6.5%).

Mosquito abatement districts across the county have been trapping and testing mosquito samples from various mosquito pools, or populations, across the county, the release says.\n\nHowever, the South Salt Lake Valley Mosquito Abatement District detected the presence of the virus in mosquito populations near Riverton, according to a Monday tweet from Riverton City government.\n\nWe have been notified that cases of West Nile Virus have been found among the mosquito population in the area by the SSLV Mosquito Abatement District.

Officials in the Uintah Basin announced in July that the virus was found in mosquito pools there, but no human cases were reported.\n\nPeople are advised to take precautions to minimize their exposure to mosquitoes and their risk to the virus, the health department's release said.\n\nPeople should use a repellent with DEET, permethrin, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus that has been registered with the Environmental Protection Agency. Long sleeves and pants are recommended after dark.\n\nPeople should also drain standing water in yards or gardens, keep gutters clear of debris, and clean and stock garden ponds with mosquito-eating fish or mosquito dunks. Window and door screens should also be kept in good condition to keep mosquitoes out of homes, and weeds and tall grasses should be kept short, the release says."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.theleader.com.au\/story\/6879045\/one-in-five-regret-lockdown-drinking\/","domain":"theleader.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-14 06:30:00","title":"Alcohol and Drug Foundation research shows one-in-five regret lockdown drinking","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.theleader.com.au\/images\/transform\/v1\/crop\/frm\/dDX6EvrE5YwXKXWPbzKfsb\/05282b8c-ed84-40b8-81dc-55e69aa6fbe4.png\/r0_3_1080_699_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg","content":"\"The last few months have been incredibly hard for everyone, particularly for those who have lost work, social [connections] and especially for those who have lost loved ones.

Hepatitis B and C are the most common cause of death with over 1.3 million lives lost annually.\n\nRegrettably, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, viral hepatitis continues to claim thousands of lives across the world, with poor attention given to it. The level of knowledge of viral hepatitis remains low among Nigerians despite the fact that it is a leading infectious cause of death and claims the lives of many each year.\n\nAs a consequence, most of the 17-21 million Nigerians estimated to be living with viral hepatitis do not know that they are infected, thus placing them at greater risk for severe, even fatal, complications from the disease, and increasing the likelihood that they would spread the virus to others.\n\nUnlike other diseases like HIV\/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria, and recently, Coronavirus (COVID-19) that had received massive support from world leaders, hepatitis, unfortunately, has received unimpressive financial and logistics support from world leaders and international donor agencies.\n\nEvidently, poor knowledge of the disease among global population, particularly Nigerians, could largely be attributed to low level of sensitisation and enlightenment about the disease. As a result, there is significant rise in number of positive cases in Nigeria.\n\nGlobally, the prevalence of hepatitis is staggering. A recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that more than 325 million people live with viral hepatitis B and C, with an estimated 2.8 million people were infected in 2018 alone.\n\nRegrettably, most people living with hepatitis lack access to testing opportunity and vaccination, which are preventive measures. Also, those tested positive seem to lack adequate access to treatment.\n\nData from the Federal Ministry of Health indicated that Nigeria is one of the countries with the highest burden of viral hepatitis with a prevalence of 8.1 per cent of Hepatitis B and 1.1 per cent of Hepatitis C, though with regional variations.\n\nThe statistics confirmed that male to female distribution varies and children are not spared. Cases of viral hepatitis are most commonly found among the age group of 21 to 40 years. But in Nigeria, there is a strong relationship between Hepatitis B virus infection and various forms of chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nFacts about hepatitis\n\nHepatitis is said to be an inflammation of the liver, which can be chronic or acute. According medical books, hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis infection, but reckless consumption of alcohol, drugs, and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.\n\nWith Nigeria having an average prevalence of 8.1 per cent and 1.1 per cent for hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, there are indications that nine out of ten people living with the viral hepatitis are unaware of their status.\n\nViral hepatitis is responsible for the death of over one million people across the world each year. It\u2019s also responsible for two of every three liver cancer deaths. Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, are the different types of Hepatitis virus; and all of the viruses cause liver disease.\n\nMajor risk factors\n\nDr Mike Omotoso, President, Nigerian Commission Hepatitis Zero Representative to the African Union (AU), said the risk factors in Nigeria are majorly cultural practices that have been on for decades across different ethnic groups in Nigeria. Such practices included local circumcision and scarification on the body, tribal marks, surgical procedures, body piercing, delivery at home and receiving blood transfusion.\n\nResearch confirmed that hepatitis viruses are transmitted through contact with the infected body fluids, contaminated injection drug needles, sharing personal items with someone who has the virus, sexual contact with someone with the virus, among several others.\n\nHe said many people engage in such cultural activities having no knowledge of health implications, particularly making them vulnerable to viral attacks. He said viral hepatitis is a major cause of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer in Nigeria, and eliminating hepatitis by 2030 as contained in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), will require enduring innovation, better access to medicines, and improved health services.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s (WHO) new recommendation, according to him, is that \u201ceverybody should have access to Hepatitis C testing and curative treatment, and global health communities should come together to officially begin moving towards the elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030. With the transmission of indigenous programs in the country in over 15 languages while being Nigeria\u2019s public radio network, Radio Nigeria has proven itself a trailblazer, a feat worthy of note.\u201d\n\nOmotoso said the Global Hepatitis Eradication Initiative (GHAI) is a commission dedicated to a vision of a hepatitis free world through advocacy, screening, prophylaxis and treatment.\n\nPreventive opportunities\n\nStudies confirmed that hepatitis can be prevented through a change in lifestyle that pre exposes someone to the risk factors. In addition, vaccination has proven to be effective in preventing the disease.\n\nAn official of Federal Ministry of Health, Dr Clement Adesegbe, admitted that vaccine has proven to be effective in case of prevention. He insisted that before the vaccine can be administered on someone, he or she must have been tested and certified hepatitis free before vaccination as preventive option. In the event that the test result returned positive, treatment will be the next action and not vaccination:\n\n\u201cThere is vaccine for Hepatitis A and B. Vaccinating against Hepatitis B will also protect against Hepatitis D, because only those with Hepatitis B stand a chance of contracting Hepatitis D. Adequate funds should be raised, domestically, to support the fight against the disease, since notable international donor agencies are yet to financially support the fight against hepatitis.\n\n\u201cWe have to look inward to get solutions to the problem. Interestingly, state governments are beginning to show positive response by committing their finances. Nasarawa and Lagos states have committed funds to the project against hepatitis. We are, equally, getting positive responses from Taraba, Adamawa, Zamfara and Cross River states.\u201d\n\nConsequences of poor funding\n\nHeartland Alliance International (HAI), human rights organisation committed to protecting and promoting the rights of extremely vulnerable populations attributed the rising cases of hepatitis in Nigeria to lack of awareness among the people. Its Chief Executive Officer, Bartholomew Ochonye, appealed for commitment from government and other individuals to the fight against hepatitis:\n\n\u201cI am concerned that the level of knowledge of the disease is low in Nigeria and that has been responsible for the rise in figure of confirmed cases. Many are unaware that they are carrying the disease because of high cost of testing.\n\n\u201cWe are working with key populations to enlighten the people about hepatitis using different platforms and our 25 centres in Lagos, Akwa Ibom and Cross River states to do that. In a society where figures of diseases like HIV\/AIDS are going largely because of increase in awareness, that of hepatitis is rising significantly due to poor knowledge about the disease. It should be a cause for concern for us all.\n\n\u201cViral hepatitis is the only disease in Nigeria that is on the increase. People must improve on their health seeking behaviour, even though it has become complicated because of COVID-19 pandemic that disrupted socioeconomic activities, globally. People must be mindful of what they eat, drink and other lifestyle particularly sexual related activities.\u201d\n\nHe commended the intervention of the Federal Government in the fight against hepatitis, but requested for more actions, particularly in the areas of testing and vaccination.\n\nTreatment\n\nIn his presentation at the commemoration, Adesegbe said: \u201cHepatitis B can best be prevented by vaccines that are safe, available and highly effective. It is not usually necessary to treat a new Hepatitis B infection in the first six months. Nine out of 10 new infections in adults clear up on its own, with or without treatment.\n\n\u201cIn early stage of the disease, treatment makes very little difference to the chances of a cure. Anti-viral drugs may only be necessary and helpful in rare cases, if the acute infection causes very aggressive liver inflammation.\n\n\u201cIn chronic (long-lasting) Hepatitis B, it is advisable to consult medical doctor about the situation. Some people need treatment, while others don\u2019t. Treatment does not usually cure Hepatitis B, but it can turn an aggressive Hepatitis B infection into a mild infection. This can stop the liver from being damaged. If the infection is considered mild, it might be better to monitor it and wait until later for treatment.\n\n\u201cVaccinating against Hepatitis B will also protect against Hepatitis D. Studies have shown that only those with Hepatitis B can contract Hepatitis D. In addition to vaccination, other ways to prevent hepatitis infections include: regular hands washing after use of the restroom, washing your hands after coming in contact with another person\u2019s blood, stool, or other bodily fluids, avoiding contaminated water and foods, do not share toothbrushes or razors, avoid illegal drugs, clean and cover cuts and wounds.\n\n\u201cThe aim of treatment for Hepatitis C is to achieve a Sustained Virological Response (SVR), meaning that the virus is not detectable in blood originally 24 weeks, now more frequently 12 weeks, after treatment has stopped. This is the equivalent of a cure because the virus does not return, unless the person is newly infected. The new drugs are showing SVR rates of approaching 100 per cent in trials."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/sg.news.yahoo.com\/us-reports-show-racial-disparities-183244714.html","domain":"sg.news.yahoo.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 18:32:00","title":"US reports show racial disparities in kids with COVID-19","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ny\/api\/res\/1.2\/tWuiFQTii8_nWyT3QmemRQ--\/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD02OTk-\/https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/ap.org\/e38eebd13fbbfe5868506758b0c2f8d7","content":"FILE - In this July 23, 2020 file photo, health care workers prepare a COVID-19 test sample before a person self-administered a test at the COVID-19 drive-thru testing center at Miami-Dade County Auditorium in Miami.

Hispanic children were hospitalized at a rate eight times higher than white kids, and Black children were hospitalized at a rate five times higher, it found.\n\nThe second report examined cases of a rare virus-associated syndrome in kids. It found that nearly three-quarters of the children with the syndrome were either Hispanic or Black, well above their representation in the general population.\n\nThe coronavirus has exposed racial fractures in the U.S. health care system, as Black, Hispanic and Native Americans have been hospitalized and killed by COVID-19 at far higher rates than other groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the impact of the virus on children has become a political issue. President Donald Trump and some other administration officials have been pushing schools to re-open, a step that would allow more parents to return to work and the economy to pick up.\n\nOn Wednesday, Facebook deleted a post by Trump for violating its policy against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus. The post featured a link to a Fox News video in which Trump says children are \u201cvirtually immune\u201d to the virus.\n\nThe vast majority of coronavirus cases and deaths have been in adults, and kids are considered less likely to have serious symptoms when they're infected. Of the nearly 5 million cases reported in the U.S. as of Wednesday, about 265,000 were in children 17 and under \u2014 about 5%. Of the more than 156,000 deaths reported at that time, 77 were children \u2014 about 0.05%.\n\nBut Friday's CDC reports are a \u201cgut punch\u201d reminder that some children are getting seriously ill and dying, said Carrie Henning-Smith, a University of Minnesota researcher who focuses on health disparities.\n\n\u201cIt's clear from these studies, and from other emerging research, that kids are not immune,\" she said. \u201dKids can pass along COVID, and they can also suffer the effects of it.\"\n\nShe said studies should give community leaders pause about opening schools. \u201cWe need to be really, really careful. We are potentially talking about putting children in unsafe situations,\u201d Henning-Smith said.\n\nChantel Salas, a Hispanic girl from the farmworking town of Immokalee, Florida, spent more than 50 days hospitalized with COVID-19. The 17-year-old had fallen ill only days after taking a picture with her diploma for her high-school graduation.\n\nAt one point, her 41-year-old mother, Erika Juarez, was told to say goodbye to her only daughter.\n\n\u201cIt was the scariest thing I have ever had to go through,\u201d said Juarez, who works at a shipping warehouse. \u201cShe had no oxygen in her body. This thing affected all the organs in her body.\u201d\n\nJuarez said Salas had no underlying health conditions and she still is not sure how she got infected because no one in her household got ill. The teen eventually was put on a machine that adds oxygen to blood before pumping it back into the body, a last resort effort to save her life. She was discharged about three weeks ago and is now recovering at home.\n\n\u201cThey keep saying she is a miracle,\u201d she said. \u201cShe recovered fast because she was very motivated.\u201d\n\nThe first CDC report released Friday was based on cases from 14 states. The researchers counted 576 hospitalizations of kids from March 1 through July 25. At least 12 were sick enough to need a machine to help them breathe. One died.\n\nThe hospitalization rate for Hispanic children was about 16.4 per 100,000. The rate for Black children was 10.5 per 100,000, and for white kids it was 2.1 per 100,000.\n\nAs with adults, many of the hospitalized children had existing health problems, including obesity, chronic lung conditions and \u2014 in the case of infants \u2014 preterm birth.\n\nA number of possible factors could explain the disparities, said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar, who oversees epidemic prevention efforts for a not-for-profit data and advocacy organization called Vital Strategies.\n\nLarger percentages of Hispanic and Black kids may go to hospital emergency rooms when they're sick, which could be driven by difficulty getting into \u2014 or paying for \u2014 doctor's office visits. That lack of access to regular health-care could lead to more severe illness, he suggested.\n\nThe second CDC report focused on 570 kids diagnosed with a rare condition, which CDC calls multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C. Ten of them died.\n\nSome children with the syndrome have symptoms resembling Kawasaki disease, another rare childhood condition that can cause swelling and heart problems. Other symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes or feeling extra tired.\n\n\u201cThe underlying problem that results in MIS-C seems to be a dysfunction of the immune system,\u201d said Dr. Ermias Belay, who is leading the CDC team looking into MIS-C cases.\n\nThe immune system kicks into overdrive when it sees the virus, releasing chemicals that can damage different organs, he added.\n\nIn the study, many of the patients with the condition had severe complications, including inflammation of the heart, shock, and kidney damage. Nearly two-thirds of the cases overall were admitted to intensive care units, and the average ICU stay was five days.\n\nThe CDC report covered illnesses that began from mid-February to mid-July. Forty states reported cases.\n\nThe report found that 13% of kids with the condition were white, while more than 40% were Hispanic and 33% were Black. Overall, about half of U.S. children are white, around 25% Hispanic and about 14% are Black, according to population estimates.\n\nScientists are still learning about the condition. Experts say genetics has nothing to do with why some racial and ethnic groups are more likely to be infected by the virus, get seriously sick from it or die from it. But it's not yet clear if genetics play a role in the childhood inflammation condition, Shahpar and Belay said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Adriana Gomez Licon in Miami contributed.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

They are an important resource, especially in our current situation with ongoing Covid-19 outbreaks. Friends give support during conflict, buffer against loneliness, and can even provide life sustaining resources when we need them,\" said Jaimie Arona Krems from Arizona State University (ASU) who is now an assistant professor of psychology at Oklahoma State University.\n\n\"We wanted to understand how we keep friendships, and we found feelings of jealousy can act like a tool for maintaining friendships\".\n\nNot all threats to friendships evoked jealousy.\n\nIf a best friend moved away, people felt sadness and anger more than jealousy.\n\nBut when friendships were threatened by another person - such as a new romantic partner or new friend at work - jealousy was the dominant feeling.\n\nThe intensity of jealous feelings varied by how likely the third-party threat was to replace someone in the friendship.\n\nA best friend gaining a romantic partner elicited less jealous feelings than them gaining a potential new friend, revealed the study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.\n\n\"The third party threats to a friendship were not just related to a best friend spending time away from us: It mattered whether the person they were spending time with could replace us as a friend,\" said Douglas Kenrick, President's Professor of psychology at ASU.\n\nThe authors found people felt less jealous about their best friend spending the same amount of time with a new romantic partner than a new acquaintance, \"which means what makes us most jealous of is the possibility that we might be replaced\".\n\nFeelings of jealousy over being replaced were associated with behaviours that could overcome the third-party threats, like trying to monopolise a best friend's time and manipulate their emotions.\n\n\"Together, these behaviors are called 'friend guarding', and they occur across cultures and also in non-human animals. Female wild horses are known to bite and kick other female horses,\" said Keelah Williams, assistant professor of psychology at Hamilton College.\n\nJealousy also led people to commit to being a better friend.\n\n\"Getting jealous can sometimes be a signal that a friendship is threatened, and this signal can help us jump into action to invest in a friendship that we might have been neglecting,\" said Athena Aktipis, assistant professor of psychology at ASU and author on the paper."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.miragenews.com\/patients-taking-opioids-produce-antibodies-that-may-hinder-anti-opioid-vaccine\/","domain":"miragenews.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 12:15:33","title":"Patients taking opioids produce antibodies that may hinder anti-opioid vaccine","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.miragenews.com\/images\/mirage.news-logo.png","content":"University of Wisconsin-Madison scientists have discovered that a majority of people they tested who were taking opioid painkillers for chronic back pain produced antibodies against the drugs that may contribute to some of the negative side effects of long-term opioid use.\n\nThe findings add to a growing understanding of how the immune system can recognize drugs and influence their effects in the body, which may ultimately support the production and delivery of a vaccine that reduces the harm of opioid abuse.\n\nCody Wenthur, a professor in the UW-Madison School of Pharmacy, led the work with collaborators at the Scripps Research Institute and Scripps Health in San Diego. Wenthur lab postdoctoral researcher Jillian Kyzer announced the team's findings Aug. 17 at the American Chemical Society Fall 2020 virtual meeting.\n\nThe researchers discovered antibodies against protein-bound opioids in 10 of 19 patients who took opioids to treat chronic lower back pain. Those who took higher doses of opioids had a stronger antibody response. A control group of three patients who did not take opioids for their back pain had only very low levels of anti-opioid antibodies.\n\nFor this initial study, Wenthur's team could only identify three patients with chronic pain who had not previously taken opioids, even after a months-long radio and print recruiting campaign. This challenge was an indication of the ubiquity of these drugs, despite evidence that they are riskier options than non-opioid painkillers for treating chronic pain.\n\n\"Opioid use disorder and opioid overdoses continue to be a major epidemic in this country,\" says Wenthur. \"A relatively new therapeutic approach entering clinical trials is what in shorthand we call an opioid vaccine, where the immune system generates a response against the drugs. But for this approach to be successful, we need to identify the people who would benefit from that approach.\"\n\nFor decades, researchers have understood that the immune system can produce antibodies against psychoactive drugs under the right conditions. While the chemicals themselves are too small for the immune system to recognize, they can permanently bind to large proteins in the blood, which can then trigger an immune response.\n\nIf a vaccine can produce antibodies capable of neutralizing the drugs, it could help people combat addiction by reducing the pleasurable feelings the drugs produce in the brain. Past trials of vaccines against nicotine or cocaine have had limited success, in part because of individual differences in how the immune system produces antibodies.\n\nAs part of their overall objective to improve the treatment of substance use disorders, the Wenthur lab is studying immune reactions to combat opioid abuse, which claims tens of thousands of lives each year in the U.S. Patients who take opioids for extended periods can develop serious side effects, including hyperalgesia, a sensitive, painful response to harmless touch. Wenthur's team thought that the immune system's response to the drugs might help explain these side effects.\n\nTo test that idea, they looked for antibodies against the drugs in people who took opioids. Kyzer worked with postdoctoral researchers Hyeri Park and Tyson Belz at the Scripps Research Institute to develop molecular traps for any potential antibodies. They linked the common opioids hydrocodone and oxycodone to a ubiquitous blood protein in the hopes that these drug-protein conjugates would bind to any opioid antibodies in patients' blood.\n\n\"When we looked, we did see a correlation between recent opioid dose exposure and the amount of antibodies that we saw,\" says Wenthur.\n\nCounterintuitively, the patients who already produce a measurable antibody response to opioids may be the least likely to benefit from a potential anti-opioid vaccine. That's because they produce a relatively weak type of antibody, known as IgM, which may reduce their ability to generate stronger, neutralizing IgG antibodies against the same drug target in the future.\n\nAs researchers advance toward a potential opioid vaccine, tests like this one proposed by the Wenthur lab might help identify the patients who are likely to benefit.\n\n\"In order to confirm these results and help us understand who might be good vaccine candidates, we need to find a larger cohort of individuals, track their opiate use history, and figure out if this is a useful biomarker for subsequent vaccine protection against overdose and for clinical outcomes like hyperalgesia,\" says Wenthur.\n\nThis work was supported by the ALSAM foundation."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.orilliamatters.com\/around-ontario\/beyond-local-why-vaccines-are-less-effective-in-the-elderly-and-what-it-means-for-covid-19-2589686","domain":"orilliamatters.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 00:55:00","title":"BEYOND LOCAL: Why vaccines are less effective in the elderly, and what it means for COVID-19","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.vmcdn.ca\/f\/files\/shared\/miscellaneous-stock-images\/palliativecare2.jpeg;w=960","content":"Vaccinologists have not focused their research on tailoring vaccines to induce robust immune responses in the elderly\n\nAs the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) \u2014 the cause of COVID-19 \u2014 continues, we learn more about the effects of this new virus.\n\nFor many respiratory pathogens, including influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses, the elderly experience the most severe forms of disease and the highest death rates.

That number increases to 5.9 people per 10,000 for those aged 65-74 years, and 47.5 people for those over 74 years old. However, most of these diseases can also have a predilection for causing severe disease in the very young.\n\nIn this respect, COVID-19 is very different. Data from relatively early in the COVID-19 pandemic showed a dramatic difference in the rates of age-associated deaths, with a case fatality rate of 4.5 per cent for patients ages 60 and older versus only 1.4 per cent for those under 60 years old, with those under 30 years ranging from zero to 0.19 per cent.\n\nImmunosenescence\n\nWe are immunologists with research programs devoted to developing vaccines. With COVID-19 placing a spotlight on the elderly as the age demographic most in need of a vaccine, we have felt compelled to evaluate how well scientists are doing at tailoring immunization strategies for this population. Our conclusion is that vaccinologists, ourselves included, have largely failed to focus their research on tailoring vaccine technologies to induce robust immune responses in the elderly.\n\nA critical factor that makes the elderly more susceptible to infectious diseases is what immunologists call \u201cimmunosenescence\u201d: the decline in the immune system\u2019s functionality as people age. This is also associated with an increase in the incidence of inflammatory diseases, because an elderly body tends to be in a state of chronic low-grade inflammation. This \u201cinflamm-aging\u201d is one reason why older people have tendencies to develop more severe forms of respiratory diseases.\n\nThe key problem with SARS-CoV-2 infection is inflammation in the respiratory tract, which can be exacerbated in individuals predisposed towards potent inflammatory responses.\n\nImmunosenescence also results in diminished responses to vaccination. Indeed, annual flu vaccines are notoriously less effective in the elderly. This phenomenon is very important in the context of the massive efforts and funds being invested worldwide into the ultra-rapid development of vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nThe fact that elderly people do not respond well to immunizations has largely been ignored in most discussions of COVID-19 vaccines, despite this being the group in greatest need. Most of the scientific community\u2019s experience with vaccine development for any disease has been focused on vaccinating the relatively young.\n\nYoung mice and elderly humans\n\nHere is an interesting exercise for people reading this article: find as many original research articles as you can on the topic of vaccine development that have used animal models (it could be for any disease). Then look in the subsection of the \u201cmaterials and methods\u201d section and check the age of the animals. We were shocked by what we found.\n\nMice are the most common animals used in preclinical vaccine research and the overwhelming majority of these are 12 weeks old or younger. This is equivalent to people 20 years old and younger. It is comparatively much rarer for studies to use immunosenescent mice that are at least 18 months old and equivalent to an elderly human.\n\nTranslational studies that take promising preclinical discoveries and move them towards clinical trials often use non-human primates such as Rhesus macaques. In the majority of cases these are around three to six years old, which is equivalent to an adolescent or young-adult human. The same trend applies to all other animals used in vaccine research.\n\nEarly-phase clinical trials focus on safety, not efficacy of vaccines. Therefore, far too many vaccines never get tested in the context of aged immune systems until Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The time to find out that a vaccine does not work well in the context of immunosenescence is not at this extremely late stage, when it is too late to fix the problem. This testing should begin in the preclinical phase where an iterative process can be followed to tailor a vaccine for a senescent immune system.\n\nInterestingly, many commercial suppliers of animals that are purpose-bred for research do not have adequate inventories of old animals. Of concern, most old mice that are readily available are of the C57BL\/6 strain. This is the most common strain used in research, and is known to have an immune system with a strong bias towards effective responses against viruses.\n\nIntriguingly, aged mice experience a more severe form of SARS after infection, akin to elderly humans. The excessive use of young mice with immune systems that are optimal for antiviral responses, and that experience less severe disease, could bias results in a way that overestimates the potential of vaccines to perform well in the elderly.\n\nDeveloping vaccines for a key demographic\n\nPeople age 65 and over suffer the most severe cases of COVID-19 and have the highest associated mortality rate. If the goal is to have COVID-19 vaccines ready for public use by early 2021, the only ones that have a chance are those that are currently in clinical trials. It is likely that most of these did not undergo preclinical optimization for an elderly population, meaning these first-generation COVID-19 vaccines may perform poorly in the people that need them most.\n\nFor the COVID-19 pandemic, it is too late to go back and build these considerations into preclinical testing. However, it is imperative that researchers still in the preclinical phase incorporate head-to-head testing of their vaccine candidates in young versus aged animals and develop strategies to optimize them in the latter. This will help the world prepare for the next outbreak of a dangerous coronavirus.\n\nFor that matter, a focus on the elderly should be incorporated into other vaccine development programs, including those to treat cancers, which have the highest incidence in older people.\n\nThere are viable strategies to improve the effectiveness of vaccines in older people, including changes in formulations, doses and routes of administration. However, it takes substantial time and appropriate animal models to conduct this research. It is possible that the elderly may need fundamentally different vaccination regimens than younger people.\n\nAlthough a few researchers do conduct vaccine studies in old animals, considerations for the elderly need to be adopted by far more vaccinologists. This is of growing importance for countries with aging populations. This will mean changing the current philosophy of the field of vaccine development and incorporating age as a critical variable.\n\nByram W.

But they remain higher than 13-19 July when 1 in 2,000 individuals were thought to be infected, with 2,800 new infections a day.\n\nGyms, salons and cinemas have been allowed to reopen, though bowling alleys, ice rinks and pilot sports events were all told a week ago to keep their doors closed amid fears in Downing Street of a surge in cases.\n\n\u201cModelling shows rates of people testing positive for Covid-19 have risen since the lowest recorded estimate, which was at the end of June, but there is evidence that this trend may be levelling off when compared with last week\u2019s headline estimate,\u201d the ONS team report.\n\nThe government has also released the latest figures for the R value and growth rate, with the former at 0.8-1.0 for the UK and the growth rate at 0% to -5% per day. Last week the figures were 0.8-0.9 and -1% to -4% respectively. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak should fizzle out.\n\nBoth last week and this week, the R value for England was 0.8-1.0. For the second week in a row, the committee behind the figures said it does not have confidence that R is currently below 1 in England.\n\nWhile at first glance this appears to suggest a less positive scenario than the ONS data, Prof Steven Riley, of Imperial College London, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), said that, when looking at figures from the past few weeks, both point to the same conclusion: the spread of Covid-19 appears to be levelling off in the community in England.\n\nRiley noted that the ONS figures draw on more recent data than the R value and growth rate \u2013 which rely more on hospitalisation and death figures \u2013 meaning the data applies to a slightly different period of time. Even so, the R value does not show a clear change in England.\n\n\u201cThere are really three regimes: you can have high confidence [infections] are going down, that would be high confidence that R is less than 1; you can have high confidence that it is going up, that would be R is greater than 1; or the only thing left is not to be sure either way,\u201d he said. \u201cLevelling off is a really good description.\u201d\n\nDr Sebastian Funk, an epidemiologist and member of SPI-M agreed, noting the uncertainty in the ONS estimates means the data is consistent with both and an increase and a decrease in new cases per day.\n\n\u201cWith both the incidence and R estimates, there is no clear trend,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018R could be above 1\u2019 is not expressing any confidence in the fact that infections might be increasing.\u201d\n\nDr Yuliya Kyrychko, a reader in mathematics at the University of Sussex, said that despite an apparent levelling off in new cases, infection remains quite prevalent in the community, noting in north-west and south-west England that the R value is possibly greater than 1 \u2013 although in the case of the latter, and London, there are too few infections for a robust R estimate.\n\n\u201cRecommendations on social distancing and other protective measures should continue to be followed to avoid a significant growth of infection in those regions,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is particularly important in the context of expected large numbers of people going to beaches over the coming weekend due to continuing heatwave.\u201d"},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.timesnownews.com\/health\/article\/as-china-seals-village-following-bubonic-plague-here-is-all-you-need-to-know-about-black-death\/634125","domain":"timesnownews.com","published_date":"2020-08-09 06:03:49","title":"As China seals village following bubonic plague, here is all you need to know about Black Death","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/iks.timesnownews.com\/s\/v1\/img\/c_tnplaceholder.png?tr=w-600,h-450","content":"As China seals village following bubonic plague, here is all you need to know about Black Death | Photo Credits: Canva\n\nKey Highlights An area of Innner Mangolia in China has been sealed after a man reportedly died of bubonic plague The plague, known as Black Death wreaked havoc in Europe in 1346-53 Here is all you need to know about the disease, its spread, symptoms, treatment, and prevention\n\nNew Delhi: As the world fights the COVID-19 pandemic, just the thought of another pandemic-potential virus or disease, is frightening. However, it seems that not a new disease, but an old one has made a comeback in China. Authorities in China have reportedly cut off a Chinese region of Inner Mongolia after a man living in one of the villages was confirmed to have died of bubonic plague infection.\n\nBlack Death, the pandemic caused by the bubonic plague disease has been termed as the deadliest pandemic and 'the greatest catastrophe ever'. For people who might not know about the pandemic, here is some background to it.\n\nBlack Death \u2013 History and Background\n\nThe disease that later came to be known as Black Death spread across Europe in the years 1346-53. many historic accounts detail the terror and losses caused due to the illness. According to reports, in the course of just a few months, 60 per cent of Florence's population had died from the plague, and similar deaths were reported in Siena. About 25 million people reportedly died of the plague in the aforementioned period.\n\nWhat exactly was Black Death?\n\nBlack Death was a pandemic of bubonic plague, a disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The bacteria circulates among wild rodents. The plague is likely to spread among humans when rodents living in human establishments, get infected. The most common rodents that spread the disease are black rats, also called house rats and ship rats. When an infected rat bites a human, the infection can lead to swelling up of the groin, thigh, armpit, neck, etc.\n\nSymptoms of Black Death\n\nThe Bubonic plague was reported to cause fever, fatigue, shivering, vomiting, headaches, giddiness, intolerance to light, pain in the back and limbs, sleeplessness, apathy, delirium, among other symptoms. One of the characteristic symptoms of the disease was buboes \u2013 one or more lymph nodes becoming swollen, hence the name Bubonic plague was given.\n\nPrevention and Treatment of Black Death\n\nThere is no vaccine for the plague in the US, according to WebMD. It is also recommended to check the CDC guidelines of the country you are vising.\n\nAvoid travelling to areas where cases of the plague have been reported.\n\nIf you live in such areas, ensure that any entryways for rodents into your home are shut.\n\nDo not let pets like dogs and cats sleep in your bed.\n\nUse gloves if you have to touch wild animals, living or dead.\n\nFor treating the disease, doctors use a variety of antibiotics. The disease is curable, and most people continue to live a healthy life, once treated. However, if the treatment is left untreated, people with the disease are likely to die.\n\nDisclaimer: Tips and suggestions mentioned in the article are for general information purposes only and should not be construed as professional medical advice.

Shah, MD, MSCE, the journal's editor-in-chief told Medscape Medical News.\n\n\"Pooled testing combines samples from multiple people within a single test. The benefit is if the test is negative, [you know that] everyone whose sample was combined\u2026is negative. So you've effectively tested anywhere from three to five people with the resources required for only one test,\" Shah continued.\n\nThe challenge is that if the test is positive, everyone in that testing group must be retested individually because one or more of them has the infection, said Shah, who is also Director of Hospital Medicine at Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, Ohio.\n\nMastrianni said early in the pandemic they started getting the \"New York surge\" at their hospital, located approximately 3 hours from New York City. They wanted to test all of the inpatients at their hospital for COVID-19 and they had a rapid in-house test that worked well, \"but we just didn't have enough cartridges, and we couldn't get deliveries, and we started pooling.\" In fact, they ran out of testing supplies at one point during the study but were able to replenish their supply in about a day, he noted.\n\nFor the current study, all patients admitted to the hospital, including those admitted for observation, underwent testing for SARS CoV-2. Staff in the emergency department designated patients as low risk if they had no symptoms or other clinical evidence of COVID-19; those patients underwent pooled testing.\n\nPatients with clinical evidence of COVID-19, such as respiratory symptoms or laboratory or radiographic findings consistent with infection, were considered high risk and were tested on an individual basis and thus excluded from the current analysis.\n\nThe pooled testing strategy required some patients to be held in the emergency department until there were three available for pooled testing. On several occasions when this was not practical, specimens from two patients were pooled.\n\nBetween April 17 and May 11, clinicians tested 530 patients via pooled testing using 179 cartridges (172 with swabs from three patients and seven with swabs from two patients). There were four positive pooled tests, which necessitated the use of an additional 11 cartridges. Overall, the testing used 190 cartridges, which is 340 fewer than would have been used if all patients had been tested individually.\n\nAmong the low-risk patients, the positive rate was 0.8% (4\/530). No patients from pools that were negative tested positive later during their hospitalization or developed evidence of the infection.\n\nTeam Effort, Flexibility Needed\n\nMastrianni said he expected their study to find that pooled testing saved testing resources, but he \"was surprised by the complexity of the logistics in the hospital, and how it really required getting everybody to work together\u2026There were a lot of details and it really took a lot of teamwork.\"\n\nThe nursing supervisor in the emergency department was in charge of the batch and coordinated with the laboratory, he explained. There were many moving parts to manage, including monitoring how many patients were being admitted, what their conditions were, whether they were high or low risk, and where they would house those patients as the emergency department became increasingly busy. \"It's a lot for them but they've adapted really well,\" Mastrianni said.\n\nPooling tests seems to work best for three to five patients at a time; larger batches increase the chance of having a positive test and thus identifying the sick individual(s) becomes more challenging and expensive, Shah said.\n\n\"It's a fine line between having a pool large enough that you save on testing supplies and testing costs but not having the pool so large that you dramatically increase your likelihood of having a positive test,\" Shah said.\n\nHospitals will likely need to be flexible and adapt as the local positivity rate changes and supply levels vary, according to the authors.\n\n\"Pooled testing is mainly dependent on the COVID-19 positive rate in the population of interest in addition to the sensitivity of the [reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)] method used for COVID-19 testing,\" said Baha Abdalhamid, MD, PhD, an assistant professor in the Department of Pathology and Microbiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.\n\n\"Each laboratory and hospital needs to do their own validation testing because it is dependent on the positive rate of COVID-19,\" added Abdalhamid, who was not involved in the current study.\n\nIt's important for clinicians to \"do a good history to find who's high risk and who's low risk,\" Mastrianni said. Clinicians also need to remember that although a patient may test negative initially, they may still have COVID-19, he warned. That test reflects a single point in time and a patient could be infected and not yet be ill, so clinicians need to be alert to a change in the patient's status.\n\nBest for Settings With Low-risk Individuals\n\n\"Pooled COVID-19 testing is a straightforward, cost-effective, and efficient approach,\" Abdalhamid said. He and his colleagues found pooled testing could increase testing capability by 69% or more when the incidence rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 10% or lower.\n\nHe said the approach would be helpful in other settings \"as long as the positive rate is equal to or less than 10%. Asymptomatic population or surveillance groups such as students, athletes, and military service members are [an] interesting population to test using pooling testing because we expect these populations to have low positive rates, which makes pooled testing ideal.\"\n\nBenefit Outweighs Risk\n\n\"[T]here is risk of missing specimens with low concentration of the virus,\" Abdalhamid cautioned. \"These specimens might be missed due to the dilution factor of pooling (false negative specimens). We did not have a single false-negative specimen in our proof-of-concept study. In addition, there are practical approaches to deal with false-negative pooled specimens.\n\n\"The benefit definitely outweighs the risk of false-negative specimens because false-negative result[s] rarely occur if any. In addition, there is significant saving of time, reagents, and supplies in [a] pooled specimens approach as well as expansion of the test for higher number of patients,\" Abdalhamid continued.\n\nMastrianni's hospital currently has enough testing cartridges but they are continuing to conduct pooled testing to conserve resources for the benefit of their own hospital and for the nation as a whole, he said.\n\nThe authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. Abdalhamid and Shah have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.\n\nJournal of Hospital Medicine. Published online July 20, 2020.

Their procedures involve face-to-face communication and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids and handling sharp instruments,\u201d the guidance states.\n\nIn an oral health-care setting, the WHO said COVID-19 is transmitted in three main ways: through the inhalation of droplets from coughing or sneezing; through exposure of mucous membrane, such as eye, nasal or oral mucosa, to infectious droplets; and through indirect transmission via contaminated surfaces\n\nThe WHO said aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), such as \u201cthree-way air\/water spray, dental cleaning with ultrasonic scaler and polishing,\u201d also pose a risk because they create airborne particles or aerosols, which \u201ccan remain suspended in the air, travel over a distance and may cause infection if they are inhaled.\u201d\n\nIn settings with widespread community transmission, the WHO said, \u201coral health care involving AGPs should be avoided or minimized, and minimally invasive procedures using hand instruments should be prioritized.\u201d\n\nThe updated guidance also recommends screening patients using virtual technology or telephone before they arrive at the facility and implementing public health measures, such as physical distancing, wearing personal protective equipment, proper hand hygiene, and adhering to cleaning and disinfection procedures.\n\nThe Canadian Dental Association (CDA) released a statement on Wednesday clarifying the World Health Organization's guidance, saying that delay of oral health care is \u201cnot relevant for the current status in Canada since there is not wide-spread community transmission of COVID-19 in our country.\u201d\n\nThe statement said Canada is experiencing \u201ccluster-contained outbreaks\u201d which allow for routine oral health care to be provided. According to the statement, Canadian dentistry takes its guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Health Canada, and the dental regulatory authorities in each province.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Canada, CDA, provincial dental associations, and dentists continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic closely,\u201d the statement read. \u201cCanadians can rest assured that dentists are infection control experts, and that dental offices continue to follow strict provincial guidelines and regulations that protect the health of patients and dental staff.\u201d\n\nThe CDA recommends that Canadians stay home and cancel or reschedule dental appointments if they have flu-like symptoms."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/inews.co.uk\/news\/politics\/recovered-coronavirus-patients-exempt-quarantine-rules-sage-covid-19-explained-570527","domain":"inews.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-03 18:58:00","title":"Recovered coronavirus patients should be exempt from quarantine rules if they develop symptoms","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/wp.inews.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/PRI_158963230.jpg?resize=640,360&strip=all&quality=90","content":"Exclusive\n\nPeople who have recently had Covid-19 should be exempt from having to self-isolate if they develop further symptoms of coronavirus, the Government\u2019s scientific advisers have suggested.\n\nThe Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) studied evidence from the country\u2019s leading virologists which concluded that it is likely people who have Covid antibodies cannot become infected again, at least in the short term.\n\nMinisters have previously floated the idea of \u201cimmunity passports\u201d, which would exempt recovered coronavirus patients from having to obey social distancing and allow them to resume their normal lives. Scientists concluded that such a move would be \u201cpremature\u201d because of the prospect that immunity could wane over time.\n\nBut at a Sage meeting last month, chaired by chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and also attended by England\u2019s chief medical officer Chris Whitty, they decided there was enough evidence to justify applying different rules to some people confirmed to have previously had Covid-19.\n\n\u2018Way forward\u2019\n\nThe recommendation to ministers raises the prospect that in future some Britons will not need to self-isolate for 10 days if they get a cough or a fever, and their household will not have to quarantine either. It could prove a boost for the economy, by reducing the number of people off work sick over the winter.\n\nThe experts said that if an individual has tested positive with both an antibody test and a PCR test, which shows whether you are currently infected, they \u201care much less likely to be infectious\u201d. They added: \u201cThis offers a way forward for releasing individuals from self-isolation or quarantine.\u201d\n\nMinutes of the meeting reported: \u201cSage advised that, based on current understanding, it would be premature to introduce immunity passports, but it advised that use of antibody positivity for short-term decisions may be possible.\u201d They called for the NHS and Public Health England to deploy widespread antibody testing during future coronavirus outbreaks so as better to understand how people develop immunity and on what timescale.\n\nTest shortage\n\nSage\u2019s conclusions, which are currently being studied by the Department for Health, are based on a paper from Imperial College\u2019s Wendy Barclay and Peter Openshaw. They found that based on animal experiments and research into previous forms of coronavirus, it is likely that people who have previously been infected with Covid-19 are much less likely to be reinfected if exposed to the virus again \u2013 and if they are, their symptoms will probably be much less extreme.\n\nA Whitehall source said one obstacle to applying different rules for people who have tested positive for antibodies is that commercially available tests are not reliable enough to base policy decisions on, but the Government is hoping to roll out the best tests more widely in the coming months.\n\nThe Department for Health said: \u201cWe are always looking at and guided by the latest scientific advice. This is a new disease and how the immune system responds following infection with the virus remains uncertain. We are undertaking some of the largest studies in the world to assess the strength and duration of immunity, including monitoring the number of people presenting with an antibody response and how this changes over time.\u201d"},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/society\/2020\/aug\/06\/how-has-coronavirus-impacted-your-mental-health","domain":"theguardian.com","published_date":"2020-08-06 16:54:00","title":"How has coronavirus impacted your mental health? | Society","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/de15f3e37d2ace0255e8e04a45e21182b6983f49\/0_328_3500_2101\/master\/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none","content":"Coronavirus has impacted not only people\u2019s physical health, but also their mental health.\n\nIn one study, more than half of people who were hospitalised with Covid-19 were found to be suffering from a psychiatric disorder a month later, including PTSD, depression, and anxiety.

Plenty of research has looked at the long-term health effects of overeating calories \u2013 which include increased fat storage, impaired endocrine (hormone) control and changes to our skeletal muscle and fat tissue. Yet little is known about how our body copes with these one-off occasions of overindulgence, and whether they have any effect on our overall health \u2013 which is what our latest study aimed to find out.\n\nHumans have a huge capacity to overeat over an extended period of time. For example, members of the Massa tribe participate in Guru Walla, the traditional fattening festival where they attempt to gain as much weight as possible by eating as much as they can. Many members gain 11 kilograms of fat in just two months by eating roughly 8700 calories per day \u2013 more than three times what most adults are advised to eat in a day.\n\nWhile this is an extreme example, it shows us that our bodies are readily capable of over-eating \u2013 which isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. Even as little as 24 hours of overfeeding can have some negative consequences for our health, including elevating blood sugar concentrations.\n\n\"Understanding how the body copes so easily with occasions of extreme calorie intake helps us understand what goes wrong in the long-term\"\n\nIn our latest study, we wanted to understand how much humans can eat when they push past the point of fullness. We also wanted to know what effect this has on the body, by measuring how overeating affects metabolism in the hours after the meal.\n\nWe looked at a group of 14 healthy men between 22 and 37 years old. In one trial, we asked them to eat as much pizza as they could until they felt full. They ate roughly 1500 calories on average \u2013 just under one large pizza.\n\nOn a separate day, we then asked them to eat until they couldn\u2019t anymore, going beyond the normal feeling of fullness. Remarkably, they managed to eat almost double \u2013 around 3,000 calories on average, though some were able to eat the equivalent of nearly two and a half large pizzas (4,800 calories). This suggested that when you feel full, you\u2019re probably only half full.\n\nIt's important to stress that eating more than we need on a regular basis isn\u2019t healthy\n\nBlood samples were taken at regular intervals for four hours after the beginning of the meal to see how the body was coping. Surprisingly, despite eating twice as much food, there was only a small increase in blood sugar and blood fat levels. Being able to keep blood sugar and fat in a normal range indicates how healthy a person\u2019s metabolism is. It can also show the risk for developing diseases, including type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn these physically active and healthy people, the body is able to control the sugar and fat in the blood after a big meal by working a bit harder than usual to control metabolism. We saw that hormones released from the gut and pancreas (including insulin), helped the body to regulate blood sugar levels. Heart rate was also elevated after the meal, confirming that the body was working harder to keep things under control.\n\nSleepier and less energetic\n\nWe also measured how people felt during the post-meal period, by looking at fullness, sleepiness, and cravings for certain types of foods. While we often feel like we have room for dessert, our study\u2019s participants had little desire to eat anything (even sweet foods) when they ate past the point of feeling comfortably full \u2013 even four hours after the meal. We also found that people felt sleepier and less energetic after eating too much.\n\nWe only measured up to four hours after the meal to get a snapshot of how the participants were coping with overeating. If we measured a longer period \u2013 six or eight hours, for example \u2013 we may have seen some more differences, especially because blood fat concentrations remain elevated for longer. However, our results tell us that one meal of overeating doesn\u2019t cause much harm for your health \u2013 although 24 hours of overeating does seem to have an effect. So the focus of further research may be to understand how our bodies cope with the next meal after a binge.\n\nFrequent occasions of overeating could lead to serious diseases. Syda Productions\/ Shutterstock\n\nUnderstanding how the body copes so easily with occasions of extreme calorie intake helps us understand what goes wrong in the long-term. Healthy humans rely on the body\u2019s ability to work harder in times of need (by increasing insulin, gut hormones and heart rate) to maintain metabolic control. When we repeatedly eat too many calories at each meal, metabolic syndrome (a combination of high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity) will ensue and the body becomes unable to react to these situations.\n\nBefore starting the study, we were expecting the body to struggle with the huge calorie surplus of overeating. Our results show the body\u2019s remarkable capacity to cope with the stress of eating too much food, by tightly regulating blood sugar concentrations and blood pressure. Throughout history, the human body has had to cope with periods of famine and abundance \u2013 this study is another demonstration of that evolutionary adaptation.\n\nThough we focused on young, healthy participants, it will be important to now look at how the body copes with overeating in people who are overweight or at risk of disease, such as type 2 diabetes. But while overeating sometimes may be normal \u2013 and doesn\u2019t pose too much of a risk to our health \u2013 it\u2019s important to stress that eating more than we need on a regular basis isn\u2019t healthy. This is partly because eating more calories than are required over a long period of time will lead to weight gain, and could lead to metabolic disease.\n\nAaron Hengist is a PhD Candidate in the Department for Health at the University of Bath.

The COVID-19 death toll in Ottawa stands at 264 residents.\n\nActive Cases\n\nThe number of known active cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa fell for a fourth straight day.\n\nThere are 139 active cases, according to Ottawa Public Health, down 16 from Saturday's report. This was again driven by a jump in resolved cases.\n\nThe number of active cases is the number of total laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 minus the numbers of resolved cases and deaths.\n\nOPH reported 22 new resolved cases on Sunday, for a total of 2,226, or just under 85 per cent of all known cases to date.\n\nA case is considered resolved 14 days after known symptom onset or positive test result.\n\nCases by Age\n\nHalf of the new cases reported Sunday were in children under ten. The other half were in people 50 to 69 years old.\n\nHere is a breakdown of all know COVID-19 cases in Ottawa by age category:\n\n0-9 years old: Three new cases (86 cases total, 21 active )\n\n) 10-19 years-old: No new cases (150 cases total, 21 active )\n\n) 20-29 years-old: No new cases (416 cases total, 29 active )\n\n) 30-39 years-old: No new cases (353 cases total, 25 active )\n\n) 40-49 years-old: No new cases (337 cases total, 9 active )\n\n) 50-59 years-old: Two new cases (354 cases total, 14 active )\n\n) 60-69-years-old: One new case (267 cases total, 13 active )\n\n) 70-79 years-old: No new cases (191 cases total, 3 active )\n\n) 80-89 years-old: No new cases (277 cases total, 3 active )\n\n) 90+ years: No new cases (198 cases total, 1 active)\n\nInstitutional Outbreaks\n\nThere are 12 active institutional outbreaks in Ottawa.\n\nOne new outbreak was added at Thorncliffe Place retirement home on Sunday.\n\nThe outbreak at Waterford Retirement has ended. There was one confirmed staff case between July 26 and Aug. 8.\n\nA single laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 in a resident or staff member of a long-term care home or retirement home triggers an outbreak response, according to Ottawa Public Health. In childcare settings, a single confirmed, symptomatic case in a staff member, home daycare provider, or child triggers an outbreak.\n\nClick here for the latest figures on all COVID-19 outbreaks in Ottawa."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-lancashire-53648362","domain":"bbc.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-05 01:43:42","title":"Coronavirus: Blackburn local tracing service launched","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/ace\/standard\/976\/cpsprodpb\/13A6\/production\/_113803050_mediaitem113803049.jpg","content":"A contact tracing system in which council staff use local knowledge to track people NHS Test and Trace cannot find has been launched in Blackburn.\n\nThe set-up was started by Blackburn with Darwen Council after the borough's director of public health said the national system was \"not fast enough\".\n\nBlackburn was \"already seeing benefits\" from the new system, the council said.\n\nAsked about the NHS system's failings, Local Government Minister Simon Clarke said it was \"maturing all the time\".\n\nBlackburn with Darwen brought in extra measures on 14 July after a spike in Covid-19 cases.\n\nLatest government figures showed the rate for new cases had fallen slightly from 81.9 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 24 July, to 77.9 in the week to 31 July.\n\nA total of 116 new cases were recorded in the seven days up to 31 July.\n\nThe Lancashire borough's director of public health, Dominic Harrison, said in a tweet the local system had been developed because the national system was \"simply not tracing enough cases and contacts fast enough\"."},{"topic":"HEALTH","link":"https:\/\/www.odt.co.nz\/star-news\/star-national\/covid-19-lockdown-likely-be-longer-three-days","domain":"odt.co.nz","published_date":"2020-08-12 00:15:00","title":"Covid 19: Lockdown likely to be longer than three days","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.odt.co.nz\/sites\/all\/themes\/starcant\/logo.png","content":"Prof Michael Baker.

So researchers are warning that we need to learn a lot more about how these two factors could converge with potentially lethal results.\n\nIn a recent article, published last month in Endocrinology, the two authors lay out the emerging connection between COVID-19 and blood clots\u2014and call for more research into how the coronavirus might impact those who are already at risk for developing blood clots.\n\nPeople who already are at an increased risk for blood clots and the complications associated with them (such as pulmonary embolism, deep venous thromboembolism, and strokes) include those who are pregnant, those who are taking hormonal birth control, and those on oral estrogen therapy (hormone replacement therapy). So, the authors write, it\u2019s worth examining whether or not people in those groups who also get COVID-19 are at an especially high risk for blood clots and health issues related to them.\n\nTo be clear, there are currently no reports of increased cases of COVID-related blood clots among those who are pregnant, on birth control pills, or taking estrogen therapy, co-author Daniel Spratt, M.D., director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at Maine Medical Center and professor of Medicine and Obstetrics-Gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine, tells SELF. However, \u201cit\u2019s definitely plausible those two things in combination would increase your risk,\u201d Taraneh Shirazian, M.D., gynecologist at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF, because both being in one of those elevated-risk groups and having COVID-19 individually increase the risk.\n\nHowever, we\u2019re still learning quite a bit about how COVID-19 affects the body, including how it might contribute to blood clots. \u201c[We\u2019re] realizing that we\u2019re just at the beginning of getting information and understanding if there\u2019s a risk or not,\u201d Dr. Spratt says.\n\nWhat we do know is that the association between COVID-19 and blood clots is there, especially among young and otherwise healthy patients, Dr. Spratt says.

Since then, however, it has fallen to around 10 new cases per day.\n\nAccording to the latest figures, 1,047 people have tested positive for the virus in Swindon.\n\nMore confirmed cases are expected in the coming days. A new pop-up test centre that opened in the County Ground car park on Wednesday tested 125 people on its first day of opening and 147 on Thursday. That is in addition to the up to 2,000 people that can be tested daily at the regional test centre in Wroughton Park and Ride.\n\nMr Maddern urged anyone who felt like they might have coronavirus to get tested. \u201cIf you experience any kind of symptom we would just rather you would go and test rather than wait for symptoms to develop.\u201d\n\nYour questions answered:\n\nWill we go into lockdown again?\n\nAt the moment, Swindon health officials say we won\u2019t. Although if \u2013 and when \u2013 we do, it will be up to the government and not the council.\n\nWhat would a local lockdown look like?\n\nIt depends. Officials have the power to shut non-essential shops, pubs, leisure facilities and limit people\u2019s movement. But it\u2019s unlikely it would go that far. In places like Manchester, people have been banned from meeting friends and family inside or in gardens.\n\nWould the whole of Swindon need to go into lockdown?\n\nNo. Interestingly, Steve Maddern said this morning that individual postcodes could be put on lockdown.\n\nWho decides when lockdown measures are put in place?\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s a decision for the government. However, the council would want it to be a shared decision between bosses at the Civic Offices and civil servants in Whitehall, as has happened elsewhere.\n\nHow would I be told if Swindon were going into lockdown?\n\nMr Maddern said: \u201cThrough any means possible.\u201d At the moment it doesn\u2019t sound like the council are looking at, for example, blanket text alerts. It would most likely be through social media and the traditional media.\n\nCan I book a facial or a slot at the soft play area for my kids?\n\nWith lockdown measures easing for a number of different businesses, this was understandably asked a couple of times at the council\u2019s media briefing on Friday morning.\n\nMr Maddern told reporters people should treat themselves.\n\n\u201cAs long as you are doing what you need to be doing to look after yourself then the business should be doing what they need to be doing to look after themselves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know in regard to things like beauticians and facialists, when you go to have that treatment done you will be following a strict protocol by them, they will be wearing masks and visors. We can never say there is no risk but it\u2019s about how we work together to make sure the risk is incredibly low.\n\n\u201cTreat yourself. If you feel like a facial, go for a facial.\u201d\n\nWho is testing positive?\n\nAt the start of the pandemic it was more men. Now, more women are testing positive for the virus. It\u2019s all ages.\n\nPeople from black, Asian and ethnic minority communities make up 50 per cent of recent cases, despite representing around 15 per cent of Swindon\u2019s population.

During this process, it may have undergone recombination events altering the receptor-binding domain.\n\nThe infection has been shown to infect Syrian hamsters, which have 18-20 residues at the contact site of human ACE2. Now, a new study published on the preprint server bioRxiv* in August 2020 shows that deer mice are also susceptible to the infection and could serve as a new secondary reservoir for the virus, enabling it to thrive in North America in this common rodent species.\n\nDeer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus).

Since its initial publication, the scientific report has now been peer reviewed and accepted for publication in a Scientific Journal. Links to the preliminary and peer-reviewed reports are available in the Sources section at the bottom of this article. View Sources\n\nDeer Mice Infection and Disease\n\nDeer mice belong to the same family and are among the most widely distributed type of rodent in North America. Some of the 56 known species are known to harbor other zoonotic viruses, including hantaviruses and Borrelia burgdorferi. The ACE2 receptor in these mice has 17-20 residues, which prompted the investigation into their susceptibility to the virus.\n\nThe researchers inoculated 9 young male and female deer mice 6 months old with the virus intranasally. They found that these mice developed signs of lung consolidation and hemorrhage, and viral RNA was detectable. However, at day 14 after infection, there was no sign of disease in the lungs but low levels of viral RNA in the lungs.\n\nVirus isolation was performed from the lungs of infected mice on days 3 and 6 but not day 14 from infection. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the recombinant viral nucleoprotein was found on day 14, but neutralizing antibody was found at low titer on day 6, with a marked increase by day 14. This is likely to have been Immunoglobulin M (IgM).\n\nThe researchers found that innate antiviral defenses appeared to be activated by the infection and declined as the virus was overcome. The presence of high levels of inflammatory cytokines indicates a pro-inflammatory type I response. Histological examination showed that the nervous system was inflamed, as well as the lungs and airways suggesting bronchial and interstitial pneumonia.\n\nDeer Mouse Transmission\n\nThe infected mice were able to transmit the virus to other na\u00efve mice through two successive passages, and oral swabs from infected mice were found to become positive for oral RNA on days 2 to 5, but then became negative after a few days. Later, however, they again became positive.\n\nWhen the viral RNA was examined in the second-passage mice, the researchers found a four-residue insertion sequence in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein. However, this was present at low levels in the inoculum virus, and at still lower levels in the original virus obtained from the supplier. This insertion was found in all the infected mice, showing a powerfully purifying selection for the insertion. The fact that this is located on the surface but away from the RBD may indicate the presence of an as yet unknown co-receptor, since another coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, uses the NTD as its RBD.\n\nThe reasons for this increase in frequency may vary, from its meeting with obstacles during transmission or because it underwent selection during the systemic spread, or because of positive selection. Further research is required to investigate this phenomenon.\n\nSimilarly, the three mice used to study transmission lost weight, but not the passaged mice, that is, those which were secondarily infected from the first three. This could be because the inoculated dose used to infect the first three was more significant, or because the wildtype virus used in these was more virulent than the passaged virus.\n\nSuitable Small Animal Model for Human SARS-CoV-2 Infection\n\nThe study shows that deer mice are a small animal model suitable for the investigation of this disease, especially since these animals show an inflammatory response, thought to be a significant reason for the severity of COVID-19 in some patients. However, Interferon\u2010gamma (IFN\u2010\u03b3) or Interleukin 6 (IL-6) expression was not markedly changed, which may be why the infected mice recovered without severe disease.\n\nThese mice can live four times as long as other small laboratory animals, including Syrian hamsters and laboratory mice, which allows the effects of age, immunity, and other events to be examined in the context of SARS-CoV-2. The researchers also point out, \u201cAs an outbred model, deer mice are more likely to reflect the diverse outcomes of infection observed in humans.\u201d\n\nCentral Nervous System Infection\n\nThe involvement of the central nervous system is interesting and could explain how the virus shows both sympathetic and parasympathetic system spread. This is the reason for the dry mouth, trigeminal neuralgia, confusion, loss of smell, and loss of taste (both to varying extents) in many COVID-19 patients. If the virus spreads to the vital centers of the brain, this could explain death as well. Moreover, more studies using this model could help uncover how infection of the sympathetic ganglia in the neck leads to heart muscle injury as well as impairment of sympathetic regulation of the brain\u2019s blood supply. This may result in a marked reduction of blood flow to the brain and skull.\n\nSpillback Events\n\nFinally, until this study, the list of mammalian hosts capable of being infected with the virus have been few, including Syrian hamsters, ferrets, and minks, as well as human transgenic mice. However, wildtype laboratory mice and rats are not susceptible. In this study, all contact deer mice became infected, showing positive viral RNA in just two days, while with inoculated mice, viral RNA became positive in 21 days, indicating sustained viral spread in the species even in the wild.\n\nMoreover, since deer mice and Syrian hamsters both belong to the cricetid rodents, this could lead to recombination within the coronavirus group. Thus, spillback events may occur, causing this species to become the secondary reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2 in North America and allowing the virus to become endemic in this continent as well.\n\nThe researchers sum up, \u201cCollectively, this work has determined that deer mice are a suitable animal model for the study of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and that they have the potential to serve as secondary reservoir hosts that could lead to periodic outbreaks of COVID-19 in North America.\u201d\n\nThis news article was a review of a preliminary scientific report that had not undergone peer-review at the time of publication.

We would prefer to avoid further aggravation and wasteful expenses, despite the fact that you made inaccurate allegations against us causing us and our families great distress.\u201d\n\nAnwar and Mir have offered that if Hussain agrees to transfer the properties for the benefit of Shumaila Farooq and her two sons and other MQM deserving families then they \u201cwill forego the past four years' outstanding rent from 221 and the potential rent for many years from 185. You can also name the families who deserve assistance on a regular basis. They will all be looked after by the mutually nominated trustees.\u201d\n\nThe letter also told Hussain categorically that his offer for Shumaila Imran Farooq to shift to a flat - bought by the party\u2019s charity The Society for Unwell & Needy (SUN) \u2013 was not sincere because the flat above a grocery shop near Edgware is small and old hence it is not suitable for Shumaila, who is also a cancer patient, and her two sons.\n\nMoreover, the letter stated that the SUN charity \u201cfunctions under strict rules of Charity Commission in England by four trustees\u201d and \u201cthe trustees do not have the authority to transfer the charity property to anyone. It is against British law. In any case, the small flat above the shops is too small and noisy for a family of an ailing mother and two children to live\u201d.\n\nResponding to accusations by MQM-London, Anwar and Mir wrote in the letter that since 1997 (when the SUN was formed) all monies received by the SUN were deposited into SUN\u2019s bank account and spent to assist the poor and needy and for the maintenance of the property.\n\n\u201cNot a single penny has ever been taken by any trustee for his\/her personal use. All accounts since the charity\u2019s inception have been lodged with the Charity Commission, for you and anyone else to examine,\u201d it said.\n\nA source in the MQM-London said that Hussain has received the letter from his former associates. The MQM spokesman did not provide a comment on the contents of the letter and whether Dr Imran Farooq\u2019s widow will be helped by Hussain as he had originally promised."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/08\/07\/politics\/abortion-arkansas-john-roberts\/index.html","domain":"cnn.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 23:36:00","title":"Judges cite John Roberts' opinion in reversing block on Arkansas abortion laws","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/200722115029-20200717-scotus-kavanaugh-v2.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_619,w_1100,c_fill\/w_1280","content":"CNN \u2014\n\nA panel of federal appeals judges used Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision protecting abortion access to allow several Arkansas abortion restrictions to go back into effect \u2013 a seemingly counterintuitive outcome that advocates on both sides of the abortion issue had predicted.\n\nThree judges on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals opted on Friday to remove a district court\u2019s temporary block on the Arkansas laws \u201cin light of Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s separate opinion in June Medical\u201d and another prior court case. The laws include a restriction on the most common procedure used in second-trimester abortions and a provision that the husband of a woman getting the abortion can sue the doctor to stop his wife\u2019s abortion.\n\nAccording to procedural rules, the re-instated laws can\u2019t go into effect for 21 days, or until August 28.\n\nJudges Lavenski R. Smith, Roger L. Wollman and L. Steven Grasz noted that while Roberts sided with the court\u2019s four liberals to strike down the Louisiana law in June, he did not sign on their reasoning.\n\nThey pointed to how in his concurring opinion, the chief justice addressed the undue burden standard, established in the landmark Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey to determine if a law creates a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. Roberts held that \u201cstate and federal legislatures [have] wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d in keeping with that decision, the judges noted.\n\nWhile the lower court in striking down the restrictions held that courts, not legislatures, must resolve questions of medical uncertainty, Roberts in the superseding Supreme Court case, \u201cemphasized the \u2018wide discretion\u2019 that courts must afford to legislatures in areas of medical uncertainty,\u201d the judges said.\n\nThe granular analysis of Roberts\u2019 opinion in a case that ultimately blocked an abortion restriction to then uphold other restrictions was anticipated by several abortions rights supporters and opponents in light of Roberts\u2019 opinion.\n\nIn a footnote, Roberts wrote that the \u201cvalidity of admitting privileges law depend(s) on numerous factors that may differ from state to state.\u201d\n\nCNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law Stephen Vladeck said at the time that Roberts suggested that he did not necessarily endorse the analysis of the 2016 decision, which focused as much on whether the restrictions actually provided benefits to pregnant women as on whether they imposed an undue burden.\n\n\u201cIn the process,\u201d Vladeck said, \u201cthe chief justice\u2019s narrower opinion implies that states making different arguments in different cases might be able to justify similar restrictions going forward. In that respect, the chief justice may have sided with abortion supporters today, but their victory may be short-lived.\u201d\n\nAbortion rights supporters who helped bring the case against the laws slammed the decision and vowed to continue fighting it in court.\n\n\u201cThis ruling is a reminder that the fight against these extreme abortion restrictions is far from won,\u201d Holly Dickson, legal director and interim executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas, said in a statement. \u201cWe are evaluating our next steps and will continue to fight to ensure these harmful and unconstitutional laws do not take effect.\u201d\n\nHillary Schneller, staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said that \u201cthe Supreme Court just weeks ago reaffirmed that a state cannot pass laws that unduly burden a person\u2019s access to abortion, and that is exactly what these laws do.\u201d\n\nOpponents to abortion access cheered the ruling.\n\n\u201cArkansas has taken a strong stance to protect the unborn from inhumane treatment,\u201d Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in a statement, adding that she would \u201ccontinue to defend our State\u2019s legal right to protect the unborn.\u201d\n\nCarol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said that her group is confident that \u201cunder the standard set forth in the 1992 US Supreme Court decision in Casey v. Planned Parenthood that this law will prevail\u201d and \u201cprotect the lives of unborn children.\u201d"},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.livemint.com\/news\/india\/imd-issues-red-alert-for-mumbai-extremely-heavy-rain-likely-on-tuesday-11596450463613.html","domain":"livemint.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 10:55:31","title":"IMD issues red alert for Mumbai, extremely heavy rain likely on Tuesday","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.livemint.com\/img\/2020\/08\/03\/600x338\/AFP_1VJ4TC_1595326710606_1596451623853.jpg","content":"The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Monday issued a red alert for Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Raigad and Ratnagiri in Maharashtra for Tuesday and said the districts will receive extremely heavy rainfall in next 24 hours.

Most states already meet that requirement and won\u2019t have to put up the extra money, he said.\n\nThat means most eligible claimants will get an extra $300 in federal benefits on top of what they already receive from the state.\n\n\u201cWe felt that was a good, generous compromise,\u201d Kudlow said.\n\n'We have to reach an agreement': Dems, White House open to deal on COVID-19 relief despite Trump's orders\n\nKudlow said the checks should start going out in a couple of weeks and will be retroactive to Aug. 1. The average state unemployment benefit is around $400 per week, so with the federal supplement, many Americans can expect to receive $700 in weekly unemployment benefits, Kudlow said.\n\nTrump ordered the extra unemployment benefits after negotiations with congressional leaders collapsed late last week without an agreement on a new relief package to help Americans still suffering from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nCongress voted in March to provide $600 in supplemental unemployment benefits, but those benefits expired at the end of July.\n\nBesides extending unemployment benefits, Trump signed executive orders suspending some student loan payments, protecting some renters from eviction and deferring payroll taxes.\n\nThe decision to let states count existing unemployment benefits as their 25% match for the federal aid could add to the legal questions surround Trump\u2019s orders. Some Democrats and other critics have argued they are on shaky legal ground or are even unconstitutional.\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

Post Covid crisis, across the world, organisations need to spend significantly on digital transformation, infrastructure update and that has created a significant spurt in IT demand.This demand is global, this is not a particular company, particular sector or a particular country. It is global across sectors and this is a very robust environment. From a supply side perspective, the great path for India is that there is no competition; only Indian IT companies can provide IT services both in digital transformation and infrastructure upgrade for the related IT services.We will create the demand environment over the next three to five years for most IT services. Of course, there will be some sort of a shift from the traditional server system to the new digital side. The overall pie is going to get fairly large. Across the board, IT services will do very well but obviously the larger ones will capture the larger part because they are a lot more prepared for the digital capability perspective. They are more prepared from the point of access to customer perspective. But in general, when that pie goes up, every company benefits.We are in general bullish for IT services and we think it is here to stay because existing demand supply dynamics. On the supply side, it is only Indian. You cannot count more than 10-15 companies which have any kind of capability to cater to this demand. So we remain quite positive on this thing.Chemicals as a theme has been around for almost five-seven years and we have been playing for quite some time and I see that continuing to remain in a meaningful manner toward next five, seven, 10 years. A big shift is happening from the specialty chemical side from China to India as we know that chemical China is a global leader and a fairly large part of the global chemical supply is from China including for India. That shift has begun to happen now or has got accelerated right now and that can be extended to many more sectors.This is a very good initiative. The government has recently taken a lot of initiatives to promote manufacturing in India. The Prime Minister has put down 25% of GDP as a target for manufacturing. Even if it gets to 20% from 15-16%, you are talking about two and a half-three years. It will happen in the manufacturing space and that will spread across the board in many sectors - chemicals, APIs, defence, auto, auto ancillaries.India has a distinct advantage. Defence is a very large importer. We are the largest buyers in the defence side and ever since the Prime Minister has come, he has talked about exporting defence equipment through India. The first step is obviously reducing imports and then you can go on to export.The interesting part is that these policies that got announced yesterday will create an ecosystem. It is not possible to suddenly start manufacturing. You need to build the whole ecosystem and it takes 5, 10 or 15 years. The companies which are ready to capture some of the opportunities, like L&T, Bharat Forge have been here though it is a small portion of that.They will tend to benefit from that but here the talk is about building the whole ecosystem. I will go back to when Maruti came in 1982. At that time, we did not have any auto ecosystem and it took 15-20 years to build the full graded ecosystem. Earlier 98-99% parts were imported into India. Today it is completely reversed and we are fully indigenised. The same thing probably will happen to defence and many more sectors as the government is pushing the whole Atmanirbhar Bharat programme.Secondly, India\u2019s competitiveness is significantly improved and that is a lot more sustainable advantage which India is getting into and that will push the actual rate towards manufacturing.That is one sector where we already have a lot of capabilities and competencies. We have competitive advantage, we have large scale capacities both in the automobile space and auto component space. As this path accelerates, you can see this getting bigger and bigger.I do not have any doubt in my mind that India\u2019s labour cost is cheaper than China\u2019s. The power cost is more or less the same as China\u2019s; logistics cost is significantly improving. It is not at a disadvantage when compared. If you collect a lot of dots, we already have one of the lowest tax rates in the world as far as manufacturing is concerned.If you connect a lot of dots, over the next three to five years, many of these sectors where India already has skill advantage or we have some sort of cost advantage, where there is government push will include some of those sectors across auto, auto components, APIs, specialty chemicals and even defence, wherever there is a skill based requirement even in capital goods.By the way, India stands to gain a lot. India is very good in that and it is one sector which can leapfrog from here. The interesting part here is that one could keep in mind that India has a strong domestic demand. When you combine domestic demand with an incremental export opportunity, it creates a great business proposition and economies of scale kind of environment and that will accelerate the whole journey far better than most of us expect. So, when a trend builds, it looks fit. But over a period of time, it becomes very big.You can go back and check when pharma happened. India did not have any ecosystem but today we have created a significant pharma industry. When IT happened, India did not have a great ecosystem but over a period of time, it just tends to build. You have to take a view with a 8-10 years perspective you cannot look at just one or two years."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.thetimes.co.uk\/article\/john-hume-a-political-titan-who-drove-the-irish-peace-process-fgftxmqlv","domain":"thetimes.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-03 16:00:00","title":"John Hume: a political titan who drove the Irish peace process","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.thetimes.com\/imageserver\/image\/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fd8dabe94-d56e-11ea-a099-b011877a86c1.jpg?crop=1946%2C1297%2C0%2C0","content":"Generations of world leaders have paid tribute to John Hume, the Nobel laureate and architect of peace in Northern Ireland, who has died aged 83.\n\nThe former leader of Northern Ireland\u2019s Social Democratic and Labour Party, who for decades waged an often lonely battle for a constitutional settlement to the Troubles, passed away this morning after a long struggle with dementia.\n\nMr Hume\u2019s death severs one of the few remaining links with the province\u2019s civil rights struggle of the 1960s and 1970s, during which the former schoolteacher and seminarian lead peaceful protests on behalf of the Catholic minority in his home city of Londonderry, which later became a crucible for the violence of the Provisional IRA.\n\nBill Clinton, the former US president, described Mr Hume as \u201cIreland\u2019s Martin Luther King\u201d.\n\nOver the ensuing decades he campaigned tirelessly to find a resolution to the Troubles. Opposed to violence, Mr Hume was central to efforts to persuade the IRA to lay down its arms and pursue a political settlement to the conflict.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Good Friday agreement, which in 1998 ushered in the mandatory system of power-sharing between nationalists and unionists that still underpins Northern Ireland\u2019s system of devolution today, bore the hallmarks of his thinking.\n\nMr Hume\u2019s contributions to ending the Troubles were hailed by world leaders and veterans of the peace process today.\n\nBoris Johnson, the prime minister, described him as a \u201cpolitical giant\u201d without whom the 1998 agreement could not have been signed. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said Mr Hume\u2019s legacy was \u201cof creating a better world for the next generation\u201d.\n\nTony Blair, during whose premiership the agreement was sealed, praised Mr Hume\u2019s \u201cepic\u201d contribution to the peace process.\n\nHe said: \u201cJohn Hume was a political titan; a visionary who refused to believe the future had to be the same as the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis contribution to peace in Northern Ireland was epic and he will rightly be remembered for it. He was insistent it was possible, tireless in pursuit of it and endlessly creative in seeking ways of making it happen.\u201d\n\nSir John Major, whose government laid much of the groundwork for the agreement, said Mr Hume had \u201cearned himself an honoured place in Irish history\u201d.\n\n\u201cFew others invested such time and energy to this search and few sought to change such entrenched attitudes with such fierce determination.\u201d\n\nMiche\u00e1l Martin, the Irish prime minister, described him as a \u201cgreat hero and a true peacemaker\u201d.\n\nArlene Foster, the Democratic Unionist Party first minister of Northern Ireland, said: \u201cJohn was a giant figure in Irish nationalism but also in the wider life of Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer deputy, Sinn Fein\u2019s Michelle O\u2019Neill, said he had been instrumental to the peace process.\n\nThe former Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, with whom Mr Hume met in secret at the height of the Troubles, said peace would not have been reached without him.\n\nMr Hume\u2019s family said: \u201cIt seems particularly apt for these strange and fearful days to remember the phrase that gave hope to John and so many of us through dark times: we shall overcome.\u201d\n\nIn later life Mr Hume remained a familiar presence in his home city despite his illness, which eventually confined him to a residential care home.\n\nTony Blair with David Trimble, left, and John Hume after a meeting in May 1998 GERRY PENNY\/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nHis long retreat from public life concluded in March 2017, when he made a final public appearance at the funeral of Martin McGuinness, whose own journey from Provisional IRA commander to deputy first minister of Northern Ireland owed much to Mr Hume\u2019s efforts to cajole the republican party towards a peaceful resolution to the Troubles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet by then Mr Hume\u2019s recollections of the period had faded almost entirely. In 2018 his wife, Pat, admitted that he had become oblivious to his life\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t actually remember the peace process now, that he spent his entire life on,\u201d Mrs Hume, who survives her husband, told RTE at the time. Mourners at his funeral will be strictly limited to 90 under Northern Ireland\u2019s social distancing legislation.\n\nAs Mr Hume\u2019s health declined, so the fortunes of his party waned. The SDLP won the popular vote in elections to the Stormont Assembly held in the immediate aftermath of the agreement but found itself increasingly marginalised as fitful spells of devolution and sectarian rancour polarised Northern Ireland\u2019s electorate.\n\nBy 2017 the SDLP had lost all three of its seats at Westminster to Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nTheir iron duopoly over Northern Irish politics appeared to portend terminal decline for both the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists, whose leader David Trimble, now Lord Trimble, shared the Nobel peace prize with Mr Hume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDiscontent over Brexit and the collapse of devolution at Stormont has since seen the party rally, however. Mr Hume lived long enough to see the SDLP retake Foyle, the constituency he represented for 22 years in the Commons, from Sinn Fein in last December\u2019s general election.\n\nAfter two and a half years of abstentionist representation at Westminster, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood had urged voters in his home city to return \u201cJohn Hume\u2019s seat\u201d to its traditional owners.\n\nThat the people of Londonderry responded to his appeal by rewarding him with a majority of more than 17,000 is testament to the city\u2019s abiding reverence for its most celebrated son."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/news.thevoicebw.com\/no-more-standard-test-for-inter-zonal-traveling\/","domain":"news.thevoicebw.com","published_date":"2020-08-11 20:08:54","title":"No more standard test for inter zonal traveling","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/thevoicebw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/Mascom-Masika-le-Ditsala-bundles.jpg","content":"The Director of Health Services, Dr Malaki Tshipayagae, has announced that the standard test for those traveling from Greater Gaborone has been waived until further notice.\n\nGreater Gaborone was placed two week lockdown which effectively comes to an end this coming Thursday ( 13 August 2020).\n\nThis comes after a scourge of COVID-19 positive cases making the area a red zone.\n\nIn a statement released this evening, Tshipayagae states that \u201cthe requirement to test has been waived until further notice in instances where those wishing to attend next of kin interzonal funerals and returning essential services, and those who may be issued interzonal permits for exempted services\u201d\n\nTshipayagae further stated that it is only when a contact tracing process identifies a person who has plans of travel where one may be required to be tested at the nearest District Health Management Team ( DHMT) before they could be issued with an interzonal permit."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com\/bangalore\/others\/record-spike-in-covid-cases-in-karnataka\/articleshow\/77551125.cms","domain":"bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-14 16:45:00","title":"Record spike in covid cases in Karnataka","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.toiimg.com\/thumb\/imgsize-447065,msid-77551116,width-400,resizemode-4\/77551116.jpg","content":"Karnataka recorded its biggest single day spike with 7,908 persons testing positive for covid in Friday's bulletin with 104 deaths.The total covid cases are now at 2.11 lakh.

What Amarinder Singh ji asking is anti-farmer and it shows the Congress's anti-farmer nature,\" Mr Chouhan said in the letter.A \u201cPakistan angle\u201d to this domestic fight between two states over GI tag for Basmati rice from MP, has escalated the issue to another level altogether. Singh said any dilution of GI tag registration may end up with Pakistan taking advantage in the international market. Pakistan also grows GI tagged basmati rice for sale in the global market.Countering this argument, Chouhan said, \"The case of APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority) with Pakistan has no relationship with Madhya Pradesh's claim as it is under the GI Act of India. It is not connected to inter-country claims of basmati rice.\"The MP government and a basmati growers' association have already lost two separate court cases filed in 2016 to challenge the exclusion of districts from a map submitted by the APEDA for getting GI tags.Singh, in his letter to the PM has said, proliferation of GI tags to any more state will dilute the market value of basmati rice and harm the interest of exporters. Other states that have GI tags for basmati are Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi, and some parts in western Uttar Pradesh and a few districts in Jammu and Kashmir."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/chicago-black-lives-matter-looting-reparations-peaceful-protests-dismissed","domain":"foxnews.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 16:55:49","title":"Chicago Black Lives Matter organizer who called looting 'reparations' dismisses peaceful protesting","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net\/v1\/static\/694940094001\/09c519d5-ad79-4b2e-8a89-ec2287feb46b\/60495aa1-7fac-465e-835b-7fd2b97c2ef6\/1280x720\/match\/896\/500\/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","content":"The Chicago Black Lives Matter organizer who justified looting as \u201creparation\u201d has doubled down \u2014 insisting this week that even calling someone a criminal is \u201cbased on racism.\u201d\n\nAriel Atkins told WBEZ that her group \u201c100 percent\u201d supports the violent looters who trashed chunks of the Windy City Monday, again repeating her claim that it is \u201creparations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of criminality is based on racism anyway,\u201d she told the NPR station.\n\n\u201cBecause criminality is punishing people for things that they have needed to do to survive or just the way that society has affected them with white supremacist BS,\u201d she said.\n\nAt least 13 cops were injured and 100 people arrested in violent clashes that led to a mostly black community in the troubled South Side to kick out a BLM march the next day.\n\nAtkins attacked Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot \u2014 who is black \u2014 for calling the looting \u201cstraight-up felony, criminal conduct.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like her deciding what is criminal and what isn\u2019t,\u201d Atkins said as she suggested that calling the thieves criminals was itself a form of racism.\n\nCHICAGO ALDERMAN CALLS ON STATE'S ATTORNEY KIM FOXX TO RESIGN\n\n\u201cI will support the looters till the end of the day.

Because they're not equipped.\"\n\nThe developments come amid reports that Trump met with Postmaster General Louis DeJoy for a \"congratulatory meeting\" at the White House last week.\n\nAccording to Cabrera, records with the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections show that the Trumps' ballots were delivered Wednesday to Mar-a-Lago, where the president declared residency last November in what may be a violation of federal election law.\n\nThe ballots were reportedly picked up by Florida Republican Party official Alex Garcia and dropped off at Mar-a-Lago. The Trumps at the time were at the president's golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. It is unclear what delivery method carried the ballots there from the president's Palm Beach club and then back.\n\nTrump, who views Florida as a critical swing state, cited \"tax purposes\" as the primary reason why he had changed his residence from New York. He cast a mail-in ballot during Florida's presidential primary in March, even though he reportedly drove by a polling place in person at least six times that month.\n\n\"It's illegal,\" Reginald Stambaugh, an attorney in Palm Beach County involved in a dispute over a dock the president attempted to erect at Mar-a-Lago in recent months, told HuffPost in June.\n\nAccording to that report, Trump tried to vote last fall as a Floridian while claiming 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. as his residence. However, election officials in Palm Beach County rejected the attempted registration, because the White House was not located in the county.\n\nTrump subsequently filed a new registration listing his residence at Mar-a-Lago, affirming with a signature that it was true. (\"I live in Manhattan,\" Trump told governors in a conference call just the week before.)\n\nHowever, Trump reached an agreement with the town of Palm Beach in 1993 allowing him to repurpose his Mar-a-Lago estate into a club in return for his promise to never live there, as The Washington Post reported in May.\n\nFlorida law bars residents from registering to vote from a place of business. The law further states that registered voters must be \"Florida residents,\" and residents must provide either a state-issued driver's license or identification card, according to the state's online registration portal. (It is unclear whether the president posses either, and the White House did not reply to Salon's questions about the matter.)\n\nThe president has spent months claiming, without evidence, that mail-in ballots invite widespread fraud and election interference. He changed his tune last week, but only in the case of his newly declared home state, whose systems he claimed in a tweet were somehow uniquely \"safe and secure.\"\n\n\"Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting, in Florida the election system is Safe and Secure, Tried and True. Florida's Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats attempts at change), so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot & Vote by Mail! #MAGA,\" the president said.\n\nFlorida is represented by a governor and two U.S. senators from Trump's Republican Party."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/av\/uk-scotland-53661372\/heavy-rain-causes-landslip-at-a83-rest-and-be-thankful","domain":"bbc.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-05 06:08:02","title":"Heavy rain causes landslip at A83 Rest and Be Thankful","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/ace\/standard\/400\/cpsprodpb\/227F\/production\/_113813880_p08mrt0t.jpg","content":"Multiple landslips have blocked the A83 Rest and Be Thankful after heavy rainfall across Argyll.\n\nTraffic Scotland said the local Old Military Road, which has previously been used as an alternative route, had also been blocked.\n\nThe incident happened as Scotland was battered by heavy rain, causing localised flooding.\n\nIn January the road was closed for two days after being covered by 1,300 tonnes of debris."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.timeslive.co.za\/news\/south-africa\/2020-08-15-free-state-farmer-convicted-for-tampering-with-eskom-electricity-meter\/","domain":"timeslive.co.za","published_date":"2020-08-15 14:22:00","title":"Free State farmer convicted for tampering with Eskom electricity meter","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.timeslive.co.za\/static\/icons\/patners\/old-mutual.png","content":"A Free State farmer has been sentenced to five years' imprisonment for interfering with an Eskom electricity meter allocated to his farm.\n\nSixty-three-year-old Willem Christiaan Venter was served with a court summons on March 20 by the Hawks\u2019 Serious Corruption Investigation unit after it was alleged that he had interfered with the meter, resulting in Eskom losing about R750,000, which his electricity bill would have amounted to.\n\n\u201cHe faced four counts of malicious damage to property in terms of the Criminal Procedure Act, of which he was found guilty as charged.

Prior to this time, there had been accusations and counter-accusations of gross misconducts and mismanagement between and among top management officers and the Chairman of Council, but that is not the focus of this piece.\n\nProf. Ogundipe is claiming that he was not given a fair hearing, and that due process was not followed by the Council, as certain conditions were supposed to be met in accordance to the University Act before he can be removed from office. I agree with him, it is injustice, but injustice in UNILAG did not start today, it has been in the system for years and this same Prof. Ogundipe is one of those who have been watering the seeds of injustice in that institution.\n\nImage\n\nA few years ago, precisely 2016, the University of Lagos Students\u2019 Union (ULSU) protested against the terrible state of students\u2019 welfare on campus; inadequate water and power supply among others were some of the major issues that the students were facing on campus at the time. The protest lasted for three days, from 6th to 8th April, and it led to the shutdown of the school for some weeks.\n\nThe management of the institution, led by Prof. Rahman Ade Bello who was the Vice Chancellor at the time, apparently angered by the audacity of the student union leaders to challenge them, did everything within their power and resources (including slander, false accusation, and legal might) to suspend some of the student leaders who led the protest. I was one of those leaders (I served as the General Secretary of the union), and I got two semesters suspension. The allegations against me were that I locked the school gate and declared protest without approval (very laughable); I did none of those, because I did not lock the gate, neither did I declare a protest. The union declared a protest and the students came out in large number to participate. At this period, Prof. Ogundipe was the Deputy Vice Chancellor in charge of Academic Management (he took over as VC from Prof. Bello).\n\nDuring one of our meetings with the UNILAG Alumni Association after some of us were served suspension letters, and apparently in their quest to gather every excuse to get rid of us by all means, Prof. Ogundipe claimed that some students threw stuff at him while they were addressing us on the third day of the protest, of course that was not true, I was there in the heat of the protest and I saw what happened; a student splashed water on Prof. Akin Oyebode (not even Prof. Ogundipe) while he was addressing us at about 6:00PM that day, and we even chided the students.\n\nHow Prof. (Pastor) Ogundipe could claim that stuff was thrown at him still baffles me till today. This is not to excuse the action of the student who splashed water, but it does not change the fact that Prof. Ogundipe did not say the truth. Of course, as students that we were, and in the midst of all the elders that we were meeting with (meeting was chaired by Olorogun (Dr) Sunny Kuku who was the Alumni President at the time), we dared not say an elderly man, the DVC at that, was lying. We kept mum and left the meeting with no headway.\n\nI wrote a 14-page letter to the Vice Chancellor to make him understand our position. We ran to the media and went to court but even that could not stop them, they had and still have friends everywhere at the top. They used everything against us. They achieved their aim. My experience in UNILAG will be documented, I took note of everything and I still have records. I will write a book.\n\nFor Prof. Ogundipe, I feel very sorry for him, because it is almost unthinkable and very shameful that a whole Vice Chancellor of UNILAG would carry placard to protest an injustice to himself, not outside of the school, not outside of the country, but in this same institution. I thought Vice Chancellors were the \u201calmighty\u201d, I thought they were untouchable. But it appears that his case is different. You see, when a system thrives on injustice, everyone gets a plate of whatever is served, however it is served. That, I believe, is what is playing out.\n\nNevertheless, University of Lagos is an institution that is bigger than any Pro-Chancellor or Vice Chancellor, regardless of whatever they do in office, they would someday leave. But I pray that they do not destroy the legacy that the institution has built over the years because of ego (or whatever it is that\u2019s going on between them).\n\nUNILAG is, and will always be my pride.\n\nEmmanuel Afolabi (AFOO)\n\nEx-ULSU Gen Sec\n\n08094720722"},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/education\/2020\/aug\/10\/university-clearing-set-to-be-the-busiest-ever-experts-warn","domain":"theguardian.com","published_date":"2020-08-09 23:02:36","title":"University clearing set to be the busiest ever, experts warn","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/b59f4a440612265892dd41337bded721bfff13a6\/0_140_3500_2101\/master\/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none","content":"A sharp rise in students applying to UK universities through clearing \u2013 months later than the traditional admissions cycle \u2013 is paving the way for the biggest-ever scramble for places, with A-level results this week set to become a \u201cpressure cooker\u201d day, experts have warned.\n\nThe Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) has predicted a record 80,000 students will find places through the clearing process this summer, up from 73,325 last year. Clare Marchant, its chief executive, says that it will \u201cprobably [be] the busiest yet\u201d.\n\nOnce the last-ditch option for students who had received poorer grades than expected, the weeks-long clearing process traditionally matches students who have failed to make it on their chosen course with a university that still has places unfilled.\n\nAmid uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic this year, including cancelled gap years due to travel restrictions, the number of students who have applied to enter university directly through clearing \u2013 instead of via Ucas in late 2019 or early 2020 \u2013 has risen by 22% to reach 8,670 compared with this time last year, Ucas statistics showed.\n\nExams were cancelled in England and Scotland this summer as a result of Covid-19, and teachers were asked to supply predicted grades and pupil rankings, which were then moderated using a statistical model designed to ensure consistency. There was outrage after the system resulted in nearly a quarter of recommended results in Scotland being downgraded. English A-level pupils are set to see even greater net downgrades of nearly 40%, the Guardian revealed on Friday.\n\nClearing has been growing in popularity as students wait to receive their grades before making choices and universities make more places available, including on 4,516 courses at 17 of the elite Russell Group universities. This year clearing opened on 6 July for students who don\u2019t hold an offer to a university and will be available to all students on A-level results day, Thursday 13 August.\n\nIt is likely to be especially popular this year as school-leavers are looking to avoid entering the job market during the coronavirus economic downturn. Several universities, including Leeds Beckett and London Metropolitan, said they are seeing an increase in applications directly to their university from students who already have A-levels.\n\nUcas reported a late surge in applications before the end of the main admissions cycle on 30 June, dispelling fears that students would be reluctant to study online and would take gap years or find jobs instead of going to university this year.\n\nExperts warned that the late application surge, cancelled gap years and few deferrals could lead to an especially chaotic day for school-leavers when they receive their A-level results. There could be fierce competition for places if English results mirror the downgraded results in Scottish highers, meaning students could fall short of their university offer conditions.\n\nMark Corver, an admissions expert and founder of dataHE, predicted a panicked \u201cpressure cooker\u201d this year. \u201cWe would read [the increase in direct to clearing applications] as another signal \u2013 along with the strong January to June applications, and fewer withdrawing \u2013 that the system is running hot. There is evidence of demand and there is probably going to be a shortage of places for UK students. Calculated grades, which will inevitably give wrong results for some, simply adds more pressure,\u201d he said.\n\nGary Davies, pro vice-chancellor at London Metropolitan, said that last year over 60% of the students his university recruited during clearing did not apply during the main admissions cycle. Many applied directly to the university, bypassing the Ucas process entirely. \u201cHigher education has traditionally been a port in a storm during a recession, because people think if there aren\u2019t jobs around, let\u2019s go to uni,\u201d said Davies.\n\nUniversities including Greenwich and Leeds Beckett said they have seen substantial increases in the number of students already holding an offer who have registered to be fast-tracked when clearing places become available on A-level results day.\n\nChris Husbands, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been seeing for the last three to four years that applications have been moving later, and there are more applications that come in after the Ucas deadline.\u201d\n\nThe University of East Anglia\u2019s academic director of admissions, Richard Harvey, said that direct-to-clearing appeals to students as it is less stressful than the main admissions, and can result in better outcomes. \u201cIt\u2019s a hassle to apply \u2013 all that visiting campuses.

It essentially means that the Armed Forces\u2014Army, Navy and Air Force\u2014will only procure all of these 101 items from domestic manufacturers. The manufacturers could be private sector players or defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs).\n\nFor years India has been among the top three defence importers in the world, the government wants to reduce the dependence on imported items in defence and give a shot in the arm to the domestic defence manufacturing industry. By denying the possibility of importing the items on the negative list, the domestic industry is given the opportunity to step up and manufacture them for the needs of the forces. As per Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks defence exports and imports globally, India has been the second largest importer between 2014 and 2019 with US$ 16.75 billion worth of imports during this period.\n\nThe private players and the DPSUs, Singh said are given a \u201cgreat opportunity\u201d to manufacture the items in the negative list \u201cby using their own design and development capabilities or adopting the technologies\u201d that can be designed by the government Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) \u201cto meet the requirements of the Armed Forces\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnnouncing the policy, Singh said that the Defence Ministry is \u201cnow ready for a big push to Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative\u201d and the ministry will introduce \u201cimport embargo on 101 items beyond given timeline to boost indigenisation of defence production\u201d.\n\nThe government has been hoping that the defence manufacturing sector can play a leading role in boosting the economy, not just for the domestic market, but to become an exporter as well.\n\nHowever, Sunday\u2019s embargo list is meant for the domestic market, largely. Singh called the negative import list a \u201cbig step towards self-reliance in defence\u201d.\n\nWhat does it include?\n\nThe list, shared by the government on Sunday, has a range of items. From simpler items to advanced technologies. The items mentioned in the negative imports list include water jet fast attack craft to survey vessels, pollution control vessels, light transport aircraft, GSAT-6 terminals, radars, unmanned aerial vehicles, to certain rifles, artillery guns, bullet proof jackets, missile destroyers, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSingh said that \u201calmost 260 schemes of such items were contracted\u201d by the Armed Forces at an \u201capproximate cost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore between April 2015 and August 2020\u201d and the government expects that \u201ccontracts worth almost Rs 4 lakh crore will be placed upon the domestic industry within the next 6 to 7 years\u201d.\n\nWere the Army, Navy and the Air Force consulted?\n\nYes. The government announced that the list was announced after due consideration by all stakeholders involved, including the three services who use the equipment, weapons and platforms that will be embargoed.\n\nAnnouncing the negative imports list, Singh said that the Defence Ministry prepared the list \u201cafter several rounds of consultations with all stakeholders, including the Armed Forces\u201d and also the public sector and private players \u201cto assess current and future capabilities of the Indian industry for manufacturing various ammunition & equipment within India\u201d.\n\nSingh, in fact also mentioned that of the \u201citems on the list worth almost Rs 1,30,000 crore each are anticipated for the Army and the Air Force\u201d while for the Navy, the anticipated items are worth almost Rs 1,40,000 crore over the same period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe mentioned that the list includes wheeled Armoured Fighting Vehicles (AFVs) with indicative import embargo date of December 2021, \u201cof which the Army is expected to contract almost 200 at an approximate cost of over Rs 5,000 crore\u201d.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Express Explained is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@ieexplained) and stay updated with the latest\n\nWill it come into effect immediately?\n\nNot immediately, but starting this year, yes. However, not all the 101 items mentioned in the list will be embargoed starting this year. The list is progressive.\n\nSingh said that the \u201cembargo on imports is planned to be progressively implemented between 2020 to 2024\u201d and the government wants to \u201capprise the Indian defence industry about the anticipated requirements of the Armed Forces so that they are better prepared to realise the goal of indigenisation\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that the list is likely to grow as \u201cmore such equipment for import embargo would be identified progressively\u201d by the Department of Military Affairs headed by the Chief of Defence Staff after consulting all stakeholders. \u201cA due note of this will also be made in the DAP (Defence Acquisition Procedure) to ensure that no item in the negative list is processed for import in the future\u201d.\n\nAs the list shows, of the 101 items mentioned 69 have an indicative embargo of December 2020. Another 11 have an indicative embargo of end of next year. The 12 are likely to be embargoed by December 2023, another 8 by end of 2024, and one item Long Range \u2013 Land Attack Cruise Missile will not be allowed to be imported after December 2025.\n\nIs this a new policy?\n\nIt was announced in May. Singh has taken cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cclarion call\u201d of \u201ca self-reliant India based on the five pillars, i.e., Economy, Infrastructure, System, Demography & Demand and announced a special economic package for Self-Reliant India named \u2018Atamnirbhar Bharat\u2019\u201d.\n\nBut the announcement was not unexpected as the government had already declared that it will come out with a negative imports list for the defence sector in May.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn her fourth presentation about the package for an Atmanirbhar Bharat, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced on May 16 that the government was working on a negative imports list. In her fourth presentation on the package for creating the ecosystem for a self-reliant India, to bring Indian economy back on the path of growth, Sitharaman had mentioned that the government will \u201cnotify a list of weapons\/ platforms for ban on import with year-wise timelines\u201d and work on \u201cindigenisation of imported spares\u201d.\n\nSitharaman had stated that the government will create a \u201cseparate budget provisioning for domestic capital procurement\u201d all of which will together \u201chelp reduce the huge defence import bill\u201d.\n\nOn Sunday, the Defence Minister announced that the ministry \u201chas also bifurcated the capital procurement budget for 2020-21 between domestic and foreign capital procurement routes\u201d and a \u201cseparate budget head has been created with an outlay of nearly Rs 52,000 crore for domestic capital procurement in the current financial year\u201d.\n\nThe other things Sitharaman had mentioned in May for the defence sector included raising the Foreign Direct Investment in defence manufacturing from 49 per cent to 74 per cent under the automatic route, improving the autonomy and accountability of the Ordnance Factory Board by their corporatisation, and building a time-bound defence procurement process and faster decision-making, including setting realistic general qualitative requirements of the weapons and equipment."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/national\/nsw\/nsw-mobile-detection-loophole-generating-millions-20200803-p55i4z.html","domain":"smh.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-03 08:20:00","title":"NSW mobile detection 'loophole' generating millions of dollars","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.ffx.io\/images\/$zoom_0.552%2C$multiply_0.5855%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_22\/t_crop_custom\/q_86%2Cf_auto\/3fdfd690e6e7a890a9a9aaaf5a9d09d4129c822f","content":"Almost one in 10 motorists caught by NSW mobile phone detection cameras are using companies to avoid the penalty in what the state's opposition is describing as a loophole that's keeping dangerous drivers on the roads.\n\nMore than $19 million was generated from the new cameras between March and June this year, Revenue NSW statistics reveal, with about 43,000 fines issued.

The expectation of a swift conclusion would be far greater here in comparison to many of the old cases that NAB is investigating and where evidence gathering is that much more difficult because of the time that has elapsed.\n\nThe probe against Mr Buzdar could well be the high-profile stimulus which will enable NAB to take a close look at the working of PTI members for any suspicious signs. The PML-Q leaders, who are key PTI allies, are already facing NAB\u2019s wrath and at least three other PTI members have been marked for inquiry by the bureau following the Buzdar affair. These facts could well be used to counter an opposition that has also fallen foul of the accountability body and has been alleging political victimisation.

On the other hand increasing trend was witnessed in the supply of Phutti day by day. New ginning factories are starting their operations. In Punjab ginning factories has started their operations in many areas. The demand of Phutti as well as trading volume is increasing.\n\nDue to the starting of spell of rains in many areas of Punjab and Sindh the supply of Phutti will be decreased as well as the quality of Phutti will also be effected. It is feared that production of cotton crop will be effected in the cotton producing areas of Sindh because of rains. If rainwater collects in the field, it will damage the crops. Rains also increase the risk of attack of viruses and insects on the crop. Farmers need to be careful.\n\nAccording to cotton market sources, an international commodity company has started buying cotton since the beginning of the season. One of the reasons for the stability in the price of cotton is that the company has so far procured most of the cotton bales and is continuously buying. However, the prices of cotton in Sindh are in between Rs 8200 to Rs 8300 per maund. The rate of Phutti is in between Rs 3300 to Rs 3700 per 40 kg.

Agriculture Minister Punjab Malik Noman Ahmad Langrial claimed that 75 lac bales will be produced in the province however no estimates were being made regarding cotton production in the provinces of Sindhi, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nAccording to media reports paddy was cultivated in the cotton belt of South Punjab. The cotton sowing decreased in Punjab during the year 2020-21. The textile industry is facing severe financial crisis because of the decrease in domestic cotton production year by year while mill owners were not properly paying to their employees because they have to bear the cost of the imported cotton.\n\nCotton cultivation area witnessed a decrease of 18 percent while the situation regarding the quality of cotton is also not satisfactory. The division of South Punjab Multan, Bahawalpur and DG Khan which were famous for cotton production but now Multan district is no longer a part of cotton growing belt but it is now turned in to a paddy growing area which is also a question mark on the performance of both provincial agriculture department as well as both federal and provincial departments working to increase the production of cotton.\n\nAccording to the information, cotton cultivation area decreased by 18.16 percent in Punjab. According to the sources during the last season of 2019-20 cotton was cultivated on forty six lac and forty nine thousand acres but during the current season it was cultivated on thirty eight lac and twenty one thousand acres.

It suggested steps should be taken to buttress the parrot population during migration and through winter.\n\nProtecting the budgie-sized species when it is on the move is incredibly difficult given the migrating birds fan out across the southern mainland and Tasmania\u2019s north-west. A simpler though still highly challenging path has been taken \u2013 to look after them in summer, when they gather to breed at Melaleuca, deep in the Tasmanian world heritage wilderness area.\n\nA study published on Monday finds this work at Melaleuca \u2013 led by Tasmanian government scientists, who have released captive-bred birds and provided nest boxes and food \u2013 has increased the number of birds that leave the breeding ground but had no impact on overall survival.\n\nBetween 1995 and 2017, the survival rate of young parrots crashed from 51% to 20%. Four out of five juveniles died during migration or over winter. While adults continued to survive at a similar rate as before \u2013 roughly three out of five \u2013 the population continued to decline as fewer young reached adulthood.\n\nThe study\u2019s lead author, Dr Dejan Stojanovic from the Australian National University, says the results are alarming, and illustrate what can happen if threatened species recovery programs are narrowly focused rather than holistic. This particularly applies to migratory species, he says.\n\nStojanovic says the species is possibly Australia\u2019s most endangered bird, and the world\u2019s most endangered parrot. He says the study shows that unless all the threats a migrant species faces are addressed simultaneously, conservation successes at a local level can be quickly erased.\n\n\u201cDespite the laudable efforts of hundreds of people \u2013 and millions of dollars invested to protect the parrots in Tasmania and captivity \u2013 these actions ultimately produced more juvenile parrots that died during migration and winter,\u201d he says.\n\nDr Shannon Troy, a Tasmanian government wildlife biologist and another author of the study, says it is as challenging today as it was 20 years to work out what is going wrong when the parrots migrate, let alone address them all. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like having a bucket with 11 holes and only 10 fingers. How do we stop this water leaking? You have to just keep moving your fingers,\u201d she says.\n\nBut she agrees with Stojanovic that new, targeted conservation efforts are needed. Scientists have a laundry list of potential hazards facing migratory parrots, including predators, habitat loss due to development and bushfire, and the arduous two-way trip across Bass Strait for a bird that weighs only 45 grams and can no longer fly as part of a larger flock.\n\nTroy says technology and the parrot\u2019s size has limited scientists\u2019 ability to track it during migration. A bird can only be expected to carry an instrument up to 5% of its body weight. For the orange-bellied parrot, that means a battery-powered tracking device has to weigh no more than about 2 grams.\n\nA trial is under way in Victoria, run by the state environment department and Zoos Victoria, using tiny satellite-linked trackers on captive-bred orange-bellied parrots recently released into the wild.\n\nWhile that work is ongoing, the parrot has had some positive news in Tasmania, in relative terms. In the spring of 2017 there were only three mature females and 14 males remaining in the wild. By the start of last breeding season the numbers were better balanced, with 13 females and 10 males.\n\nBy April, after the introduction of captive-bred adults and juveniles, the number of birds heading north for the winter had reached 118 \u2013 the first time the flock had surpassed 100 in more than a decade. It followed the expansion of a government captive breeding program. Troy says it will be a good result if 40 to 50 return to breed from next month.\n\nStojanovic says the work to develop a robust captive parrot population in Tasmania has given some insurance against the species going extinct, but the latest study \u2013published in the Birdlife Australia peer-reviewed journal Emu \u2013 indicates it may not be enough unless further steps are taken. \u201cOur results suggest that business as usual will not save this species.\u201d\n\nHe favours \u201cheadstarting\u201d \u2013 capturing juveniles after they leave the nest and holding them in captivity for their first year of life to allow them to develop before they attempt migration. \u201cIt will buy us some time to figure out what else we can do to protect the wild birds in situ,\u201d he says.\n\nMore broadly, he hopes scientists and policymakers working to prevent the loss of more threatened species will learn from the parrot\u2019s plight.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of birds today where orange-bellied parrots were 20 years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hope this study is a lesson that protecting migratory species can\u2019t just happen at one time or one place. Otherwise it will be quickly undone.\u201d"},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/en.antaranews.com\/news\/154310\/president-highlights-digital-infrastructure-role-during-pandemic","domain":"en.antaranews.com","published_date":"2020-08-14 13:49:51","title":"President highlights digital infrastructure role during pandemic","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.antaranews.com\/cache\/1200x800\/2020\/08\/14\/p-Pembukaan-masa-persidangan-140820-ak-8.jpg","content":"President highlights digital infrastructure role during pandemic\n\nThe pandemic of COVID-19 has shown that the availability and functioning of digital infrastructures has become very significant and strategic.\n\nJakarta (ANTARA) - President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) highlighted the importance of digital infrastructure, especially amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, while delivering the Annual Budget Speech 2020 on Friday.\u201cThe pandemic of COVID-19 has shown that the availability and functioning of digital infrastructures has become very significant and strategic,\u201d Jokowi said while addressing the nation in front of the House of Representatives at the Parliamentary Complex of Senayan in Jakarta.Hence, about Rp30.5 trillion (around US$2 billion) from the Brief of State Budget 2021 will be allocated for the development of information and communication technology (ICT) in the upcoming year and it will focus on the acceleration of digital transformation, he stated.It would benefit the nation as it will be used for governance as well as providing fast and efficient public services, such as in the education and health sectors, and also to realize inclusive communities across the development-priority areas, with Internet access for about 4 thousand villages in the outermost regions, he added.Aside from that, the infrastructure budget of about Rp414 trillion (nearly US$28 billion) will be used for economic recovery, basic needs provision, and connectivity improvement.\u201cThe spend on infrastructure will be directed towards strengthening digital infrastructure as well as pushing logistics efficiency and connectivity,\u201d the President noted.

Four expressways, including Delhi-Mumbai, Ahmedabad-Dholera and Amritsar-Jamnagar are scheduled for completion by March 2023. Nine more will be ready by March 2024.A status report prepared by NHAI shows that nine other greenfield highways would be completed by March 2025. The combined length of these expressways is close to 7,800 km and would require investment of approximately Rs 3.3 lakh crore in the next five years.This network of expressways is spread across the country connecting Surat, Solapur, Lucknow, Vizag, Chennai, Bengaluru, Vijywada, Raipur, Kota, Kharagpur and Siliguri. Officials said the projects with 2023 and 2024 deadline would be bid out by next year.The massive development of new expressways is a major departure from the conventional mode of widening the existing highways. The move is aimed at ensuring the seamless movement of people and cargo, including heavy vehicles. Currently, cargo vehicles in India cover about 400 km per day, which is at least 50% less than the global standard. There is scope to reduce the cost and time by up to 50%.To ensure there is no fund crunch, NHAI will set up Special Purpose vehicles (SPVs) to fund these projects. The SPV will be set up for Delhi-Mumbai expressway, for which the NHAI Board comprising members from Niti Aayog and finance and highways ministries has given the go-ahead. NHAI has registered the SPV.The investment made in the project would be recovered from toll collections, which includes auctioning the tolling right for 15-20 years to a private entity to get the money upfront. This model is known as Toll Operate and Transfer (TOT). \u201cIf this model becomes successful, we will adopt this for other major highway projects,\u201d NHAI chairman S S Sandhu said.Since the SPV will be fully owned by NHAI, it would be easy to get the loan at a cheaper rate from financial institutions, including pension and insurance funds. NHAI being a statutory entity, it has sovereign guarantee and hence investors face no risk."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/nairobi\/article\/2001381503\/section-of-our-staff-covid-19-positive-asymptomatic-dpp-haji","domain":"standardmedia.co.ke","published_date":"2020-08-06 04:18:38","title":"Section of our staff Covid-19 positive but asymptomatic, DPP Haji","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.standardmedia.co.ke\/assets\/img\/logo.PNG","content":"A section of staff members of the Office of Directorate of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) have tested positive for Covid-19 but are asymptomatic and stable, the DPP Noordin Haji has said.\n\nHaji (pictured above) said in a statement sent to newsrooms this evening that his office rolled out mass testing targeting staff members on July 30, 2020, after which some of his colleagues were found to be having the virus.\n\n\u201cThe results so far reveal that some of our staff are asymptomatic carriers and in conformity with recommendations of World Health Organisation (WHO), we shall be moving to the next phase of tracing and treating the affected in liaison with the Ministry of Health,\u201d he noted.\n\nAlthough he did not mention the number of the affected employees, the DPP said that most of the workers had previously been engaged in open court prosecutions.\n\n\u201c\u2026majority of the asymptomatic cases which have been detected are mainly amongst officers serving in Divisions that have been participating in open court proceedings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a clear indicator that those who participate in open court proceedings during this time of the pandemic are highly exposed to the disease because of human interaction that we have no control over within the courts,\u201d Haji said.\n\nTo remedy the situation, Mr Haji has revealed his intention to engage the National Council on Administration of Justice (NCAJ) to look into the safety of the prosecutors, judges, magistrates, lawyers and members of the public engaged in litigation.\n\nHe, however, reassured the public that the incident would not paralyse the duties of his office even as they proceed with mass testing.\n\n\u201cOur prosecutors have always worked hard and continue to do so to ensure that the wheels of justice do not ground to a halt.

She asked why the federal government, which manages private aged care, had not prevented outbreaks in Victoria that have lead to dozens of deaths and hundreds of infections, given that there had been an outbreak in New South Wales\u2019s Newmarch House aged care home months earlier.\n\nVasilakis asked why a mandatory requirement for aged care staff to wear personal protective equipment was not brought in until 13 July.\n\nA clinical nurse specialist, Abbey Fistrovic, said the outbreaks were \u201cpreventable\u201d, and neglect of the aged care sector had created \u201ca perfect storm\u201d over a decade.\n\n\u201cThis was preventable because we could have prevented it 10 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201c I worked as a personal care attendant during my undergraduate of nursing 13 years ago. And the problems then are still the same as the problems now.\n\n\u201cThere are no mandatory requirements for personal care attendants with the amount of residents they look after. Sometimes you have one registered nurse for a facility with 100 residents. And when you have a casualised workforce that is paid too little, that work across multiple services in order to bring money into their homes and put food on the table, we have created this perfect storm which has ended in tragedy for people with families in aged care.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition MP Andrew Laming, a former doctor, was asked why the federal government had not done more to prevent the outbreaks in aged care. Q+A\u2019s host, Hamish Macdonald, asked him why a 2018 report into aged care, written by Prof John Pollaers, had not received a detailed response from the government.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a response,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it has to be given to the professor. But on the ground, the greater concern is the training and the reinforcement of those requirements around Covid-19 in every aged facility around the country.\u201d\n\nLaming said: \u201cThe focus is probably right now on the frontline.\u201d He added: \u201cFor most of this crisis so far we\u2019ve had no certainty supply of PPE and we\u2019ve had to work extremely hard through a taskforce to fill the national stockpile.\u201d\n\nThe Labor MP Ged Kearney, a former registered nurse whose father-in-law died of Covid-19, said: \u201cThe Morrison government has failed aged care.\u201d\n\nFistrovic and other doctors on the panel also said they were \u201cstruggling\u201d as more and more frontline health workers contracted Covid-19.\n\n\u201cMorale is quite low at the moment \u2026 not just the huge numbers we\u2019re seeing, but also the facts that my friends, colleagues and healthcare workers all over Victoria are now testing positive,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are struggling on the frontline now.

Andrew Cuomo on Thursday for trying to lure the wealthy back to New York with the promise of tax breaks \u2014 and said he would like to raise taxes on the rich if federal coronavirus aid doesn\u2019t come through.\n\nHizzoner\u2019s remarks came days after Cuomo said he was begging rich New Yorkers who fled to their vacation homes during the coronavirus pandemic to return \u2014 and was even offering to cook them dinner.\n\n\u201cTo the point about the folks out in the Hamptons, I have to be very clear about this, we do not make decisions based on the wealthy few,\u201d de Blasio told reporters during his daily press conference Thursday. \u201cI was troubled to hear this concept that because wealthy people have a set of concerns about the city that we should accommodate them \u2014 that we should build our policy and approaches around them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works around here anymore,\u201d the mayor continued. \u201cThis city is for New Yorkers, this city is for people who live here, work here, fight to make this place better, fight through this crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of New Yorkers who are wealthy, who are true believers in New York City, and will stand and fight with us \u2014 and there\u2019s some who may be fair-weather friends,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we must build our policies around working people.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio ended his not-veiled shot at Cuomo by again backing calls from Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-The Bronx) and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Westchester) for a new tax on the Empire State\u2019s well-off as Albany stares down a potential $30 billion hole in its budget over the next two years.\n\nThe governor infuriated his left flank at a press conference in Manhattan on Monday when he dismissed calls for boosting taxes on the rich to stave off a potential 20 percent cut to major programs, like school funding.\n\nPrevious 1 of 3 Next Bill de Blasio James Messerschmidt Andrew Cuomo ZUMAPRESS.com Advertisement\n\n\u201cI literally talk to people all day long who are now in their Hamptons house who also lived here, or in their Hudson Valley house, or in their Connecticut weekend house, and I say, \u2018You got to come back!

Inside court 9, where Mpho Thobane is standing trial for the murder of his girlfriend Viwe Dalingozi in November 2018, not much had changed since his last appearance in March, and the case was postponed to September 22.\n\nBut it is perhaps necessary to step back and remind ourselves what is at stake with case number 41\/2012\/2018. On the night of October 25 2018, residents of Fashion Lofts in downtown Johannesburg, were awakened by a raging fire on the 9th floor of the building. The fire had started at apartment 910, where 31-year-old Dalingozi lived. It obliterated her flat and damaged 911, where her neighbour, Maletsatsi Ngoashe, was jolted awake by loud popping sounds and the unbearable heat of the fire next door. She and her child managed to escaped the flames, but Dalingozi did not. She died in hospital two days later, having sustained severe burns to 66% of her body.\n\n\u201cI saw Viwe running,\u201d Ngoashe told the court during her testimony in November. \u201cShe was on fire, and she was screaming \u201cnditshisiwe nguMpho\u201d (Mpho has set me alight). I saw a huge flame coming from her flat and I followed her as she was running towards the stairs but could not catch up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer hair was falling off and she had blood on her chest, she was trying to take off her T-shirt, it was burnt, she was trying to remove it from her body but couldn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nRemarkably, Dalingozi would make it down three flights of stairs, until Nandi, who lived on the building\u2019s sixth floor, opened her door on hearing the commotion. It was she who called for help.\n\nShe also handed her phone over to Dalingozi to make a last desperate call to her uncle, Fezile Dalingozi: \u201cMalume, nditshisiwe. Ndiyoyika. Ndizakufa.\u201d [Uncle, I have been set alight. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m going to die].\n\nThe cellphone played a central role in the unfolding of the events of October 25, 2018. Ngoashe told the court that earlier that day, Thobane \u2014 who lived next door with Dalingozi \u2014 knocked frantically at her door and asked to borrow some airtime to make an \u201curgent\u201d phone call. When she told him she had none, he left, and she didn\u2019t see him again that night.\n\nBut she did hear him. She was woken by loud voices coming from Dalingozi\u2019s flat, separated from hers by a thin drywall.\n\nThe state alleges that there was a screaming match between the couple, and it would end with Thobane setting his sleeping girlfriend on fire and fleeing the scene.\n\nOne of the state\u2019s first witnesses, a security guard who was stationed downstairs in the building, testified that he had seen the accused leaving Fashion Lofts. The security guard again saw Thobane exit the building when the fire was noticed.\n\nThe state alleges that the first trip was to a nearby petrol station, where Thobane bought the fuel he doused over this sleeping girlfriend. But the state dropped arson charges against Thobane, because there was no physical evidence gathered, nor any witnesses to attest to his alleged garage trip. The official report on the cause of the fire simply reads: \u201cUndetermined.\u201d\n\nThis was just one of a litany of oversights and mistakes made in the initial investigation.\n\nWhen the matter was heard in March, the state asked for a postponement to allow it to corral its last two witnesses and find suitable dates for them to testify. One is Nandi, the person on the sixth floor, possibly the last person to have any interaction with Dalingozi after she had suffered the severe burns that would later kill her, and before she was rushed to Charlotte Maxeke hospital, where she later died. The second is Dalingozi\u2019s attending doctor.\n\nIt is expected the state will conclude its case after they have taken the witness box.\n\nHow much longer the matter of the death of Viwe Dalingozi will grind its way on in the Johannesburg magistrate\u2019s court will depend on whether Thobane will mount a defence."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/entertainment\/ashton-kutcher-slams-pence-trump-lack-of-relief-deadly-derecho","domain":"foxnews.com","published_date":"2020-08-15 16:16:51","title":"Ashton Kutcher slams Pence, Trump for lack of relief following deadly derecho in Iowa: 'Wake up'","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/896\/500\/kutcher-trump-ap.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","content":"Ashton Kutcher put the federal government on blast for failing to provide relief after a derecho ripped through his home state of Iowa and other states of the Midwest this week.\n\nThe actor, 42, used his Twitter account to sound off, claiming little has been done to help get Iowa back on its feet after a swath of destruction and power outages were a result of its 800-mile trek.\n\nThe storm system tore from eastern Nebraska across Iowa.

Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now\n\nIn August 586 BCE, after months of siege, the Babylonian troops breached the walls of Jerusalem and proceeded to destroy and burn the city, including the Holy Temple. The moment marked one of the most dramatic events in Jewish history and is commemorated to this day with the fast of the 9th of Av, which centuries later also became the day when the Second Temple was annihilated by the Romans in 70 CE.Just a few steps from the Temple Mount, one prominent two-story building, probably used for administrative purposes, was also set on fire and collapsed. Over 2,600 years later, its carbonized beams and stones uncovered in the Givati parking lot excavation at the City of David National Park represent an incredibly vivid testimony of those grievous days, whose appalling events are described in the Bible.\u201cBy the ninth day [of the fourth month] the famine had become acute in the city; there was no food left for the common people. Then [the wall of] the city was breached. All the soldiers [left the city] by night through the gate between the double walls, (\u2026) On the seventh day of the fifth month\u2014that was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon\u2014Nebuzaradan, the chief of the guards, an officer of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. He burned the House of the LORD, the king\u2019s palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem; he burned down the house of every notable person,\u201d reads the last chapter of the book of II Kings.Among the most notable remains of the building, the archaeologists noticed several fragments of a sophisticated plaster floor. Those pieces, left in the same position for millennia, proved to be essential for measuring the intensity and direction of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field in those precise moments.\u201cEven though my PhD is in archaeology, this is an interdisciplinary research between archaeology and live sciences,\u201d Vaknin told the Post.Among his advisors was Dr. Ron Shaar, the director of the Paleomagnetic Lab at the Hebrew University.\u201cOne of the goals of their lab is to understand how the magnetic field behaved in the past before direct measurement began some 400 years ago at the initiative of the captain of a British ship,\u201d Vaknin said.Over time the collection of data has become vaster and more precise. The mathematician Carl Friederich Gauss developed a system to measure the intensity of the phenomenon in the 19th century. Today, the most accurate information is provided by satellites, which are not influenced by any human interference that might occurred on the planet.However, decades after Nobel Prize winner Albert Einstein described the fluctuations of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field as one of the five mysteries of physics, many enigmas remain.While currently and in modern history the direction has been associated to the geographic north, making it a pillar of navigation systems for centuries, in the past the magnetic field is known to have been completely neutral or even pointing south. Since it also represents an essential factor to screen the planet from dangerous solar radiations, the scientists worry about what could happen if such changes should occur again.\u201cRecently we have seen many instances in which live sciences are giving a contribution to archaeology, but in this case also the opposite is true,\u201d Vaknin highlighted.For his PhD, him and his advisors decided to focus on the issue of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field in archaeological layers resulting from massive destructions.When objects containing magnetic minerals burn at a very high temperature, those minerals are re-magnetized and therefore record the direction and the magnitude of the field in that precise moment. Artifacts like pottery, bricks and tiles, which are fired in furnaces, ovens and kilns, can all provide these records. However, as precise as their dating can be, it usually spans of at least a few decades. On the contrary, if documented by historical records, destruction lawyers can be pinned down to a very specific moment \u2013 in the case of Jerusalem in 586 almost to the date - providing a unique opportunity.\u201cThe focus of my research was the Iron Age, which in Israel goes from around 1200 to 586 BCE. At the beginning I tried to focus on a different archaeological site where they had uncovered traces of the Babylonian destruction also located in the City of David but I was not able to carry on the measurements effectively. I was then suggested trying just across the street,\u201d Vaknin recalled.At that moment, the archaeologists were not sure that the remains that they had recently unveiled at the Givati parking lot dated back to the Babylonian destruction or were to be associated with the more recent Persian or Hellenistic periods, outside the scope of the PhD student\u2019s research.\u201cSince I was so close, I decided to try anyway,\u201d he explained.The preliminary results of his measurements seemed very promising. Only a few months later, the archaeologists reached the floor of the building and the findings confirmed the dating and offered new insights.\u201cWe dated the destruction of the structure to 586 BCE - the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians, based on smashed pottery vessels typical of the end of the First Temple period, found on the floor. Apart from the broken utensils, we found signs of burning and large quantities of ashes,\u201d the directors of the excavation, Dr. Yiftah Shalev of the IAA and Gadot of TAU explained in a press release.Vaknin focused on measuring the magnetic field of the numerous fragments of floor scattered around, finding out that regardless of their position, they recorded the same magnetic direction.\u201cMeasuring magnetic data from a floor burned thousands of years ago is no trivial matter,\u201d commented Shaar. \u201cWe had to characterize the magnetic particles, understand how the magnetic data was coded in the material, and develop measuring techniques enabling us to read this data. Nature hasn't made life easy for us. Thus a significant part of the analytical work we do at the paleomagnetic lab is investigating the magnetic properties of the archaeological materials. Fortunately, in this particular study, Yoav was able to decipher nature's magnetic code and give us important information from several angles: historic, archeological and geomagnetic.\"Vaknin highlighted that in order to conduct a similar process, carrying out the measurements on objects that are still in their original position in the field after the destruction is essential. Artifacts from the same period which have been moved can provide information regarding the magnetic field\u2019s magnitude but not its direction. In the future though, researchers will be able to use this system to date the remains they uncover.The team is already working on carrying on similar research on destruction lawyers from different periods in other sites, such as the one caused by the Assyrian conquest in the 8th century BCE.The ultimate goal is to create a new system of precise dating based on the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and its changes by reconstructing them in a curve.\u201cWe are building the curve from a lot of data and the idea is that the destruction lawyers which are very precisely dated are the chronological anchors for all this information,\u201d Vaknin concluded."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/life-style\/life\/1319823\/Should-you-open-the-windows-in-hot-weather","domain":"express.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-07 08:20:01","title":"Should you open the windows in hot weather?

The agency asked for $1.2 billion.\n\nBut the expected vehicle for the funds would be the next coronavirus relief bill, which is now at a standstill. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump announced he would take executive actions to deliver aid to Americans affected by the pandemic after Democrats and the White House were unable to reach an agreement on a stimulus bill.\n\nWith no imminent legislation in sight and a stalemate in Congress over the stimulus, the likelihood additional funds willgo to USCIS has all but diminished. Furloughs, if they happen, could bring the immigration system to a halt.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s currently no plan B,\u201d a congressional aide told CNN, adding that the next likely opportunity to shore up funding is in September through appropriations legislation unless a Covid package comes together. \u201cThe question is whether (USCIS will) delay furloughs and give us that opportunity,\u201d the aide said.\n\nUSCIS, a fee-funded agency, has been at the center of Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. Over the last three years, the agency has rolled out a slew of changes that have made applying for immigration benefits more challenging.\n\nSome outside experts point to the administration\u2019s restrictionist policies as a contributing factor to the budget shortfall.\n\nBetween the end of fiscal years 2017 and 2019, for example, USCIS received nearly 900,000 fewer petitions, according to Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. She added that the decrease was largely driven by the administration\u2019s own decisions, such as ending Temporary Protected Status for nationals of several countries and drastically decreasing the number of refugees admitted to the United States.\n\nUSCIS previously planned to begin furloughs August 3 but pushed the date to August 30 following assurances from Congress and an uptick in application and petition receipts, the agency said.\n\n\u201cIn the past few months, USCIS has taken action to avert a fiscal crisis, including limiting spending to salary and mission-critical activities,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cWithout congressional intervention, USCIS will have to take drastic actions to keep the agency solvent.\u201d\n\nAsked about the stalled stimulus talks, USCIS declined to comment on any pending legislation. CNN also reached out to the Office of Management and Budget for comment.\n\nOf its nearly 20,000 employees, 13,400 employees are at risk of being furloughed. That\u2019s raised alarm among lawmakers, employees, and former officials who warn that a disruption in the workforce could wreak havoc on the immigration system.\n\n\u201cA furlough would be devastating not only to the civil servants and their families who would be without a paycheck \u2013 but devastating also to millions of legal immigrants and lawful permanent residents, as well as to millions of American citizens,\u201d Michael Knowles, president of the American Federation of Government Employees local union that represents Washington, DC, area employees, told lawmakers in July.\n\nUr Jaddou, who previously served as USCIS chief counsel, echoed those concerns, underscoring that a diminished workforce would result in even longer processing times and bring the system that hundreds of thousands of immigrants rely on to a standstill.\n\nJaddou also noted that there could be a surge in filings, which comes with money, before a new fee regulation goes into effect. \u201cIs it enough to forestall a furlough as planned? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.\n\nLawmakers have similarly raised concern about furloughs. Senate Appropriations Committee Vice Chairman Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, welcomed news of USCIS delaying furloughs late last month, but said he \u201cremain troubled the Trump Administration was pushing for these furloughs in the first place.\u201d\n\nThe question looming over the next few weeks is whether those furloughs will happen as planned this time around or be pushed again."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.ndtv.com\/india-news\/j-k-domicile-law-new-domicile-law-unease-in-kashmir-valley-jammu-for-different-reasons-2273555","domain":"ndtv.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 14:45:07","title":"New Domicile Law Worries Kashmir Valley, Jammu For Different Reasons","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/c.ndtvimg.com\/2020-01\/nbo1km7_jammu-and-kashmir-shutdown-reuters-_625x300_25_January_20.jpg","content":"Some people feel the new domicile law was designed to force homogenisation in the area (Representational)\n\nNew domicile rules in Jammu and Kashmir are creating uneasy moments in each the two principal regions of the newly-formed union territory. However, these apprehensions are for different reasons.\n\nPeople in the Kashmir Valley claim the new law is designed to change the territory's demography, while those in Jammu fear an influx of population from border areas.\n\nThe centre has, so far, issued four lakh domicile certificates. According to available data, 75 per cent of these (or three lakh certificates) have been issued in Jammu.\n\n\"Almost 85 per cent of domicile certificates issued have been given to people who already had state subjects,\" Pawan Kotwal, Principal Secretary (Revenue), told NDTV.\n\nAccording to Mr Kotwal, the number of certificate issued to refugees from western Pakistan is not, for now, very large. \"Those who are applying, we are granting them certificates,\" he added.\n\nThe Home Ministry has said that so far around 20,000 certificates have been issued to people from that region. A further 2,000 have been given to people from the Valmiki community and 700 to the Gorkhas.\n\nAccording to the ministry, most of these people live in the Kathua, Samba and Jammu regions, while a few of the Gorkhas reside in the Baramulla area.\n\nThe centre had said domicile rules were modified to benefit the marginalised and minority groups in Jammu and Kashmir, but the people aren't very happy.\n\n\"Nowhere in the country is a domicile law as weak as it is here. Anyone with the help of 10th and 12th school certificate can get one,\" a senior bureaucrat complained.\n\nAccording to him, the number of refugees from western Pakistan applying for domicile certificates is low because many already have PRC (permanent residence certificate) and, per law, every PRC is now entitled for domicile law.\n\nThe western Pakistan refugee community consists of members from Hindi-speaking and Sikh communities who migrated after the 1947 partition.\n\nThe Valmikis also migrated - from Punjab. \"They have been staying here for years now, although their numbers are not much. But they also need to be given rights in terms of education and jobs,\" a senior North Block bureaucrat said.\n\nAccording to him this legislation has ensured rights on the basis of social welfare.\n\n\"Their children have been staying here and speaking the same language. Why should they be marginalised?\" he asked.\n\nThe change, however, is not welcomed by all of Jammu, with palpable resentment among the Dogras.\n\n\"In the name of Hindus every one - Kashmiri Pandits, western Pakistan refugees, Valmikis - are going to settle in Jammu. But resources - jobs and higher educational seats - are limited,\" a senior officer pointed out, adding that this would only increase pressure on Jammu over the coming days.\n\n\"Even the BJP, as a political party in J&K, is dominated by Kashmiri Pandits,\" another officer said, adding that the Pandits were given preferential treatment at medical institutions and colleges, in terms of both seats and job opportunities.\n\n\"We have been marginalised in our own region,\" he lamented.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Valley people are upset because they feel the centre, with this legislation, wants to homogenise the area. \"It will further deepen conflict,\" a local politician warned."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2020\/aug\/14\/queensland-government-withdraws-plan-to-ban-reporting-of-unproven-corruption-claims-before-elections","domain":"theguardian.com","published_date":"2020-08-14

Queensland government has withdrawn a proposal that would ban the reporting of unproven corruption allegations during election campaigns, after a backlash from media outlets and the journalists\u2019 union.\n\nOn Thursday the state attorney general, Yvette D\u2019ath, tabled the legislation based on recommendations made by the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission.\n\nThe proposal would have made the publication of a corruption allegation during an election period subject to punishment of up to six years in prison.\n\nBrisbane\u2019s only daily newspaper, the Courier-Mail, ran a front page headline describing the changes as a \u201cwar on free speech\u201d.\n\nThe Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance Queensland organising director, Michelle Rae, told the ABC the proposed changes were designed to reduce accountability.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process of what feels like battening down the hatches in a pre-election period,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe change will undoubtedly restrain reporting on allegations of substance and MEAA members are simply trying to do their jobs.\n\n\u201cQueensland is one of the only states that doesn\u2019t afford protections to journalists doing their jobs, and now wants to attack them further for reporting on the government.\u201d\n\nThe CCC had twice recommended legislation to prevent vexatious and politically motivated complaints.\n\nThe anti-corruption body has grown increasingly concerned that baseless allegations of corruption were being lodged in an attempt to effectively slander political opponents; and that these complaints were subsequently being used as the sole basis for media stories, including in cases where the complaint was found to lack substance.\n\nThe CCC proposal would have restrained the reporting of corruption allegations that had been lodged within three months of the election and not yet assessed by the CCC.\n\nIt did not restrict reporting if the CCC had assessed the complaint and decided to launch an investigation.\n\nIt is unclear whether the proposal would have in practice restricted the media from reporting relevant facts about the conduct of politicians or candidates, or whether the restriction would only block reporting of the fact an unproven allegation had been made.\n\nIn a statement on Friday morning, D\u2019ath said the government \u201crespects the recommendations of the CCC\u201d.\n\n\u201cHowever, given the limited time for the parliamentary Legal Affairs Committee to consider the law changes the CCC seeks, the \u2026 bill introduced yesterday in state parliament is withdrawn.\u201d\n\nIn several high-profile instances the opposition Liberal National party has announced that it has made complaints to the CCC, but the CCC has ultimately found the alleged behaviour did not amount to corrupt conduct.\n\nThese include complaints made about the former treasurer and deputy premier, Jackie Trad, who was twice investigated and cleared.\n\nBefore the Brisbane council elections last year, the LNP released a public statement claiming it had referred \u201cgrave allegations\u201d about a Brisbane councillor, Kate Richards, to the CCC.\n\nDays earlier, the LNP\u2019s powerful vetting committee had attempted to persuade Richards not to nominate to recontest her council seat.\n\nIn an extraordinary statement clearing Richards of wrongdoing, the CCC criticised the LNP\u2019s decision to issue a press release stating it had made a complaint.\n\n\u201cThe publication of a complaint can also lead to unsubstantiated allegations being aired publicly, and may give the appearance a complaint is motivated for political gain or other reasons,\u201d the CCC statement said."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/www.thesun.ie\/news\/5769434\/teenager-charged-dangerous-driving-death-kimberly-o-connor\/","domain":"thesun.ie","published_date":"2020-08-11

Leaders listened as citizens weighed in against starting the school year in person.\n\n\u201cOut of 50 or 60 public comments, only one person supported in-person learning,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hopeful.\u201d\n\nFortner hoped on behalf of the rattled teachers he advocated for as a member of the local teacher\u2019s union. Those educators were afraid of coronavirus spreading rampantly in schools teeming with crowds of ebullient young people. Without tenure, many teachers didn\u2019t feel confident about speaking out, he said. Nonetheless, the community appeared on their side, arguing for virtual classes.\n\nBut then the board voted overwhelmingly to support a hybrid model of both online and in-person learning, to be implemented when students return on August 26. His heart sank.\n\n\u201cI was just blown away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a jaw-dropping moment after three and a half hours of public comment. It was an avalanche moment for our community.\u201d\n\nTeachers are in the crosshairs of the national reopening debate\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines explaining how schools can potentially return to in-person classes this fall if case counts are low enough. And the American Academy of Pediatrics has urged districts to return to in-person classes, citing potentially devastating social and emotional losses to children that could occur otherwise.\n\nBut Fortner is one of countless teachers across the country forced to decide between bringing home a paycheck for their family and potentially entering what feels like a microbial war zone every day, risking constant exposure to hundreds of other teachers and kids.\n\nFortner plans to keep teaching this year. However, he\u2019s not sure how much he\u2019d be able to accomplish teaching International Baccalaureate courses on novels and poetry to mask-clad students, while trying to monitor who in the back row might be holding back cough symptoms.\n\n\u201cMy priorities will shift from self-actualization, learning and knowledge toward policing public health guidelines,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen anyone doesn\u2019t have their basic needs met, they can\u2019t learn and grow.\u201d\n\nLocal school board decisions are affecting more than 50 million students enrolled in K through 12 education, according to US Census data. And the National Center for Education Statistics charts the number of US public school teachers at 3.5 million.\n\nIn a normal year, they\u2019d be in classrooms this fall. During the pandemic, the picture is much more complicated.\n\nOf the 15 biggest school districts in the United States, 13 have chosen to begin classes completely online as of August 6. Only Hawaii Public Schools chose a hybrid route, as did the rural Missoula County, in Montana. And New York City, once the US epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, plans to offer a blended model of virtual and in-person learning, provided the city\u2019s infection rate stays below 3%.\n\nThey hail from the big sky country of Montana, the fields of Iowa, the outskirts of our nation\u2019s capital and the streets of Atlanta. America\u2019s teachers are the foot soldiers in our ongoing war with a deadly pandemic.\n\nAnd not all of them are willing to go along with their leadership\u2019s decisions.\n\nJami and Drew Cole, two Oklahoma educators who\u2019ve been married for 29 years, are shouldering the burden.\n\nThey are both immunocompromised. Jami Cole, who teaches fifth grade, has rheumatoid arthritis, while her husband, a high school art and media production instructor, has leukemia.\n\nThey take solace in the fact that their rural county has had significantly lower case counts so far than more densely populated areas of the country. But they keep a close eye on how the virus is spreading in their state.\n\n\u201cIt does keep me up at night that we could be exposed anywhere,\u201d Jami said. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality that we\u2019re living in a Covid world that I can walk out of my door and my neighbor could have it.\u201d\n\nAs they prepare to return to their classrooms, they estimated they\u2019ve spent $500 out of pocket for personal protective equipment and for innovative supplies to help maintain physical distancing. The stress is taking its toll, however.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had some pretty severe breakdowns, just crying in my bathtub or crying in my bed like I\u2019m not ready,\u201d Jami said.\n\nAnd her husband said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t have been brokenhearted\u201d if the school system had held only virtual classes for the first nine weeks.\n\nA young teacher resigns to keep her grandmother safe\n\nAshima Gauba, is a 23-year-old Georgia Tech graduate and Teach for America corps member who spent the summer following the news and preparing for her second year of teaching computer science at Benjamin Banneker High School in Atlanta.\n\nShe lives with her parents, 26-year-old sister, brother-in-law and 84-year-old grandmother. Both Gauba and her sister are immunocompromised because of gut conditions, so the family orders all its groceries online and avoids contact with the outside world.\n\nAshima Gauba (right) lives with her grandmother and resigned from her position with Fulton County Schools so that she wouldn't risk bringing the coronavirus home to her family. Courtesy Ashima Gauba\n\n\u201cIf one of us is going to the dentist, they call ahead and wait in the car,\u201d she said.\n\nOver the summer, she started a petition to encourage Fulton County Schools to have a virtual start to the fall semester. The system did eventually opt toward starting online for the first few weeks but has plans to return to in-person classes.\n\nGauba took issue with several policies she saw in the employee handbook, including mask mandates for teachers but not students, and the fact there wasn\u2019t a requirement for someone who tested positive to furnish evidence of a negative Covid-19 test before returning to school after two weeks of quarantine.\n\nGiven her family\u2019s health needs, she felt as though the district\u2019s precautions weren\u2019t adequate. Not only did she want to quit: She was also willing to pay $1,000 to break her contract to be able to avoid crowds.\n\n\u201cIt felt like neglect. It felt like my family is being undervalued. It felt like I was being undervalued,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like your life or the life of people you love doesn\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things.\u201d\n\nGauba resigned from her teaching job on July 29, announcing her decision on Instagram and Remind, a platform that teachers use to communicate with students.\n\n\u201cI had imagined that my students might be angry,\u201d she said, recounting her emotions as she debated how to deliver the message. She had worried they would see her as choosing her family over them.\n\nInstead she was met by heart emojis, well wishes toward her family and encouragement to \u201cStay safe, Ms. Gauba.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was heartwarming and heartbreaking,\u201d she said. \u201cMy students are more caring than many of our world leaders and school district officials are.\u201d\n\nThis week she started a new job in which she can safely work from home, landing a program analyst role with Flockjay, a company that works to train groups traditionally underrepresented in tech and place them into tech sales roles at companies.\n\n\u201cIt really feels like a continuation of what I was trying to do with teaching,\u201d she said. \u201cAs my students get older, I want for them to be able to have the same opportunities in the tech industry.\u201d\n\nMaking the best of it\n\nMore than 600 miles away in Riverdale, Maryland, Jeselle Percel has a considerably different outlook on the year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to get back to the job I love so much and that I\u2019m passionate about,\u201d said the first grade teacher at Templeton Elementary School, just outside Washington, DC.\n\nJeselle Percel is gearing up to teach first grade online at a school just outside of Washington, DC. Courtesy Jeselle Percel\n\nOne reason for optimism is that her school has committed to strictly online learning this year.\n\nThat decision came following a survey of administrators, teachers and staff, in which a majority favored a virtual format.\n\n\u201cI was concerned because a lot of people think we can have \u2026 desks 6 feet apart, masks, gloves and reduced class sizes,\u201d she said. \u201cIn practice, that would be very difficult at the elementary level.\u201d\n\nBut in avoiding the risk of in-person teaching, Percel knows she has to tackle the socioeconomic divide that makes virtual learning incredibly difficult in a school district populated by a vibrant community of new immigrants to America.\n\nShe instructs kids from Central America, the Middle East and Africa, many of whom are in English as a Second Language courses and don\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi at home.\n\nTechnology issues were a major hurdle for Percel last spring when her school abruptly pivoted online. Many of her students\u2019 parents were frontline workers and couldn\u2019t easily pick up laptops from the school for their children to use at home. And a rule of one laptop per family created problems teaching students who had other siblings attending the same school.\n\n\u201cThere were all these obstacles to even begin learning,\u201d she said.\n\nPercel and her school district have had more time to prepare this year, but she knows her task teaching first graders online will be much more difficult than even in neighboring districts, where families are more affluent and can better endure the upheaval in work routines needed to supervise all the complexities of keeping kids connected and on task.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that leaders keep in mind students coming from low-income communities, who are disabled and who are still learning English,\u201d she said. \u201cThe ones that I serve are left behind. Their needs haven\u2019t been met in the current education system that America has.\u201d\n\nTwo married teachers prepare totally different classroom designs\n\nWith reopening decision being made on a local level, the complexion of the new school year can look very different even in districts near each other.\n\nKylie Schipper, a kindergarten teacher in a small rural district in central Iowa, is preparing to teach her young students in person while prioritizing social distancing. Meanwhile her husband, Leland Schipper, a high school math teacher in a nearby urban district, will be teaching his next semester of courses virtually.\n\nLeland and Kylie Schipper both teach in Iowa. Their son is starting kindergarten this year at the same school where his mom teaches. Courtesy Leland and Kylie Schipper\n\nUsually in late summer, the couple shuttles back and forth between each other\u2019s classrooms preparing each space for the first day of school. That ritual looks a lot different this year, with Kylie\u2019s kindergarten classroom undergoing a coronavirus-related overhaul while Leland\u2019s will remain empty as he teaches students online from a home office.\n\nTo space out fidgety kindergarteners, Kylie Schipper is eschewing group desks, which would place students in close quarters in little pods of six. Instead, her classroom layout features yoga mats on the floor, spaced 6 feet apart.\n\n\u201cTheir little bodies get so bored of sitting, they just can\u2019t do it. And you lose their attention and you lose your focus,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so for me, the mostimportant thing was I needed some some way to be able to have them moving, but then be able to have their own space seated and learning from, too.\u201d\n\nShe purchased some of the new classroom fixtures herself, and was supported by friends and families as well, who picked ways to help from an Amazon wish list she posted on Facebook.\n\nHer husband has been on his hands in knees in the classroom slicing out kid-size rectangles from a long foam roll, which the couple position at intervals on the classroom floor next to plastic containers in which kids can store books and belongings.\n\nBoth teachers are enacting their specific district\u2019s directives. Divergent as the requirements may be, the couple feel they reflect a democratic consensus.\n\n\u201cPart of that is just the communities that they represent, the polling that both of our school districts did of our communities show different results about what people preferred in returning,\u201d Leland Schipper said.\n\nFor many teachers, it\u2019s not possible to quit\n\nBack in Montana, Fortner is feeling boxed in, desperately trying to figure out how to balance his commitment to his family with his lifelong vocation. His school system offered options for teachers to take a leave of absence if they weren\u2019t comfortable with teaching in person, but financially he felt that route was a nonstarter.\n\nThe father of two, in his mid-40s, is married to a teacher, and they are paying down hundreds of thousands of dollars in mortgage and student debt.\n\n\u201cIf my hands weren\u2019t tied, I\u2019d walk away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat teacher can afford that? We can\u2019t afford to stay home even if we want to.\u201d\n\nHe worried how these reopening decisions would affect an already severe national teacher shortage, and he lamented the lack of discussion on hazard pay for teachers.\n\n\u201cI question my loyalty to a system that isn\u2019t concerned with people who are high-risk,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m worried some teachers won\u2019t be able to do it.

The true story of the former personal attorney to President Donald J. Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some ways, I knew him better than even his family did because I bore witness to the real man, in strip clubs, shady business meetings, and in the unguarded moments when he revealed who he really was: a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a con man,\u201d Cohen wrote in the 3,700-word release.\n\nThe White House responded to Cohen\u2019s upcoming book, calling it \u201cfan fiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cMichael Cohen\u2019s book is fan fiction. He readily admits to lying routinely but expects people to believe him now so that he can make money from book sales. It\u2019s unfortunate that the media is exploiting this sad and desperate man to attack President Trump,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Brian Morgenstern said.\n\nThe White House did not address specific claims made by Cohen in the book\u2019s foreword.\n\nThe website and foreword are kick-starting the publicity campaign for Cohen\u2019s claimed expose on the decade he spent working as Trump\u2019s fixer. Cohen has said he plans to release the book in September so it would be available before the presidential election.\n\nSkyhorse Publishing told CNN in a statement Thursday night that it is the publisher of Cohen\u2019s book. The publishing house has published books by other controversial authors, including Woody Allen\u2019s autobiography and a book by National Enquirer editor Dylan Howard.\n\nOn his website, Cohen is selling signed copies for $40 and unsigned hardcovers for $32.50.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to multiple crimes, including lying to Congress. He was released last month to home confinement after suing the Department of Justice, alleging he was taken back into custody in retaliation for the book. A judge agreed and prosecutors dropped their request to restrain Cohen\u2019s communication with the media.\n\nNow, Cohen is launching his publicity campaign. It began Thursday when Cohen tweeted \u201ccoming soon\u201d along with a copy of the book cover, which depicts a photo of him dressed in a suit that is imposed over the bars of a prison cell.\n\nIn the foreword, Cohen writes that he has received threats, contemplated suicide and had a panic attack the day of his public testimony before Congress, in what would be the first public airing of his years working for Trump following his guilty plea.\n\nCohen wrote that he was a \u201cdemented follower\u201d who acted as Trump\u2019s bully, fixer and designated thug.\n\n\u201cI stiffed contractors on his behalf, ripped off his business partners, lied to his wife Melania to hide his sexual infidelities, and bullied and screamed at anyone who threatened Trump\u2019s path to power,\u201d Cohen wrote.\n\n\u201cOur cellphones had the same address books, our contacts so entwined, overlapping and intimate that part of my job was to deal with the endless queries and requests, however large or small, from Trump\u2019s countless rich and famous acquaintances,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCohen also addressed the investigation by former special counsel Robert Mueller into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election and his role on the Trump Tower Moscow project.\n\nWhen Cohen pleaded guilty, he admitted that he lied when he told Congress that the discussions about the project ended before Trump\u2019s campaign began in earnest \u2013 in truth, he said, they continued well into 2016 campaign \u2013 and about his communications with members of the Trump family.\n\n\u201cTrump had colluded with the Russians, but not in the sophisticated ways imagined by his detractors. I also knew that the Mueller investigation was not a witch-hunt. Trump had cheated in the election, with Russian connivance, as you will discover in these pages, because doing anything \u2013 and I mean anything \u2013 to \u2018win\u2019 has always been his business model and way of life,\u201d Cohen wrote.\n\nCohen doesn\u2019t provide details of how Trump allegedly cheated.\n\nHe alleges that Trump \u201cattempted to insinuate himself into the world of President Vladimir Putin and his coterie of corrupt billionaire oligarchs. I know because I personally ran that deal and kept Trump and his children closely informed of all updates, even as the candidate blatantly lied to the American people saying, \u2018there\u2019s no Russian collusion, I have no dealings with Russia\u2026there\u2019s no Russia.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn a court filing, Cohen also said that the book will provide \u201cgraphic and unflattering details about the President\u2019s behavior behind closed doors\u201d including Trump\u2019s \u201cpointedly anti-Semitic remarks and virulently racist remarks against such Black leaders as President Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela, neither of whom he viewed as real leaders or as worthy of respect by virtue of their race.\u201d He said the book will be based on personal anecdotes and \u201cdocumentary evidence.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys sent Cohen a cease-and-desist letter earlier this year to block the publication of the book. Cohen\u2019s attorney, Danya Perry, told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d last month that letter said Cohen signed a non-disclosure agreement but the attorney had no recollection of having signed one.\n\nPerry said at the time she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there wasn\u2019t another legal effort to block the book\u2019s publication.\n\n\u201cCertainly there\u2019s a pattern there, but I expect, just as with some of the previous rulings that we have seen, that attempt will not be successful and this book will be published before the election,\u201d she said.\n\nLast week Cohen informed the judge overseeing his release that an unnamed political action committee has offered him employment to provide consulting services and media appearances. Cohen cannot start any employment without the approval of the Bureau of Prisons, according to the terms of his confinement."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/pune\/maharashtra-imd-issues-rain-red-alert-for-aug-17-in-pune-and-satara\/articleshow\/77574179.cms","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-16 11:58:00","title":"Maharashtra: IMD issues rain red alert for Aug 17 in Pune and Satara","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.toiimg.com\/thumb\/msid-77574198,imgsize-24979,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72\/77574198.jpg","content":"Representative image.\n\nMUMBAI: The Met department on Sunday issued a red alert of extremely heavy rainfall on Monday at isolated places in Pune and Satara districts in Maharashtra, an official said.

She's got the numbers in Parliament to pass whatever she wants. She's got New Zealand First, the Greens and her party - they've got the numbers - so why is she blaming National?\" Collins argued.\n\n\"She's blaming our outgoing MP Nicky Wagner for holding up the Bill. For goodness sake, doesn't she realise - Jacinda Ardern - that she's the Prime Minister and she's got the numbers? If she can't control [her Government], is that my problem?\"\n\nThe SOP, submitted on July 2, says \"up to 10,000 New Zealanders\" currently use oral pouches as an alternative to smoking.\n\nWagner's proposed amendment reads: \"During the consideration of the bill the Ministry of Health advised the Health Select Committee that oral nicotine products are significantly less harmful than smoking.\n\n\"As oral tobacco-free nicotine pouches are administered through the oral route (between the top lip and the gum) no respiratory risk is associated and the route of administration has been proven through nicotine gum and sprays with no adverse health problems.\"\n\nSmokeless, oral nicotine pouches, commonly known as 'snus', can contain either tobacco or non-tobacco ingredients. The pouch, placed between the top gum and upper lip, is used as a smoking alternative and can help smokers kick the habit.\n\nHowever, Collins referred to the product outlined in the amendment as \"chewable tobacco\", saying the smoking alternative is \"used by people in our military who happen to be addicted to nicotine\".\n\nYet according to Ministry of Health guidelines, in 2018 the District Court found that all tobacco products may be lawfully imported, sold and distributed under the SFEA - \"except types that are chewed or otherwise absorbed through the oral mucosa e.g. snus\". As aforementioned, snus or oral nicotine pouches do not have to contain tobacco.\n\nCollins argued that the SOP is \"sensible\", saying Ardern can either \"get behind\" the amendment or pass \"whatever she wants\".\n\n\"Why is Ardern blaming a backbench MP for it? Why doesn't she just get behind it and understand that this is a sensible amendment which is why New Zealand First is supporting it?\" Collins said.\n\n\"What's causing [the delay] is that the Prime Minister can't control her numbers and she won't let this amendment go through. If she can't control her Government, that's not my problem - and it's not the problem of Nicky Wagner, who's a backbench National MP.\n\n\"If she can't do that, that shows how weak she is on it. She needs to take a stand.\"\n\nSpeaking to The AM Show on Tuesday, Wagner called Ardern's earlier claims \"inaccurate\", arguing the whole point of the Bill is to provide additional \"mechanisms\" and alternatives to help Kiwis quit smoking.\n\nWagner says she \"played around\" with the SOP, which still bans all oral nicotine except from \"one minor item\".\n\n\"Which is a nicotine pouch,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not tobacco. It isn't snus. She told a colourful story about snus. It's not snus.\"\n\nAnother SOP released by the National MP on July 30 amends the Bill to make \"non-tobacco nicotine pouches a notifiable product for the purpose of the Bill\" - removing the pouches from the prohibition on the sale and distribution of oral nicotine products - in recognition of the product's utility \"as an aid to help smokers quit\"."},{"topic":"NATION","link":"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/city\/chennai\/aiadmk-cm-war-spills-over-eps-ops-call-truce-for-now\/articleshow\/77567794.cms","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-15 22:36:00","title":"AIADMK CM war spills over, Edappadi K Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam call truce for now","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.toiimg.com\/thumb\/msid-77568873,imgsize-277887,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72\/77568873.jpg","content":"Posters hailing O Panneerselvam as permanent CM had cropped up at several places in Theni district late on Friday\n\nCHENNAI: The debate over the AIADMK\u2019s CM candidate for the forthcoming assembly polls is no longer a closely guarded secret. In the wake of supporters of deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam putting up posters in Theni district demanding that he be made the CM candidate, hectic parleys were held in the party on Saturday to defuse the crisis.A group of 14 ministers, sent as emissaries by CM Edappadi K Palaniswami , held two rounds of discussions with OPS and EPS at their official residences to put to rest all debate over the CM-candidature.Both EPS and OPS chose not to visit each other\u2019s house. OPS also stood his ground not to yield to EPS\u2019s invitation for a meeting to sort out issues, if any. Panneerselvam conveyed to the senior leaders that time was not ripe to discuss the chief ministerial candidature. What is evident is that fissures are wide, to the extent that the CM and his deputy needed emissaries to hold discussions.The only positive outcome for the party and the government was a joint statement issued by EPS and OPS in the evening, warning party functionaries (read ministers) against airing their views before the media without the approval of the party high command. The statement, referring to the views expressed by some senior functionaries (ministers), said, \u201cWe won\u2019t achieve anything by expressing our views in public.The party leadership will follow the path of Amma (Jayalalithaa) and take important decisions on policies and alliance formation by holding discussions in the party in a democratic manner\u201d.

The leaders should act more cautiously and responsibly as the party approaches the next assembly polls.Ministers Sellur K Raju and K T Rajenthra Balaji, who triggered the debate over the CM candidature, were conspicuous by their absence in the delegation.

Last week, Elachi suspended plenary sittings to September, just a day after her office was notified of the impeachment motion against her and after the courts issued an order halting the appointment of Edward Gichana as the new assembly clerk.\n\nIn a notice, the embattled Speaker said the \u201ccurrent environment at the assembly cannot allow for virtual sittings\u201d, citing attempts by some ward representatives and \u201cgoons\u201d to disrupt the sittings.\n\nWaithera, the South B MCA, has, however, said the impeachment motion would go on. She said Elachi had no powers to suspend the House since she is suspended from her duties.\n\nAccording to section 11(6) of the County Governments (Amendment) Act, 2020, the Speaker shall not perform any of the functions of the Office of the Speaker pending the resolution of the county assembly.\n\n\u201cWe are proceeding with the impeachment. The House has not adjourned. Only members can adjourn it, not the Speaker. The House calendar has to be followed and as far as we are concerned, we are still in session,\u201d said Waithera, adding that the House is supposed to go on recess on August 13.\n\nBut Elachi maintained that she invoked Assembly Standing Order No 1, which gives her the liberty to adjourn the House in special circumstances.\n\nFor the motion to proceed, the clerk of the county assembly must first verify signatures collected and ascertain they meet the required threshold of 42 signatures for a notice of impeachment motion to be tabled before the assembly.\n\nThe problem is there are two clerks - Jacob Ngwele and Edward Gichana - who have both been suspended from performing their duties by court order pending determination of a case before the Employment Labour and Relations court.\n\nIn the absence of the clerk, the deputy clerk in charge of legislative affairs is supposed to take charge of the impeachment process, but she has been interdicted. Currently, the deputy clerk in charge of administrative affairs Pauline Akuku, a close ally of Elachi, has taken over.\n\nAkuku has maintained that her office has never received any notice of motion for the removal of Elachi.\n\nShe also claims the notice of impeachment motion letter containing the grounds of Elachi\u2019s dismissal by Ngwele was written on letterheads phased out by the assembly following increased incidents of falsification of assembly documents, thus it borders on forgery.\n\n\u201cI wish to clarify that you (Speaker) ignore any media reports suggesting that a notice of motion for your removal from office was issued and that you are curtailed from performing the functions of your office. You should treat such information as rumours, gossip and media hype and continue executing your functions unhindered,\u201d Akuku said in a letter to Elachi yesterday.\n\nThe final hurdle for the pro-impeachment MCAs is who will chair the impeachment sessions.\n\nActing Speaker?\n\nAccording to the County Government\u2019s Act, once notified of the ouster motion, the Speaker should step aside pending the resolution of the county assembly and the Deputy Speaker takes over.\n\nBut both Speaker Elachi and her deputy Kamangu are facing ouster, meaning that a member of the Speaker\u2019s panel should sit in and preside over the plenary.

In order to continue, it needs light and water, and it produces most of the oxygen in the atmosphere. According to the latest research, Mars may be able to create \u201cradiative habitable zones\u201d\u2014zones where a thick enough covering of ice would block off the sun\u2019s harmful radiation while still allowing enough light to support photosynthesis.\n\nThese findings need to be interpreted in the correct context, much as photosynthesis requires the ideal amount of light to occur. The findings do not imply that life has ever existed on Mars or exists now, but they do provide scientists conducting the ongoing search with a direction to search.\n\nThe \u201chabitable zone\u201d is the area surrounding a star where conditions are favorable for liquid water to exist on a planet\u2019s surface, and this includes both Earth and Mars. Mars seems to be a largely dry landscape, despite the fact that 71% of Earth\u2019s surface is covered in oceans with liquid water.\n\nIt has been revealed by observations made by Mars missions like the Curiosity and Perseverance rovers that this was not always the case. These robots\u2019 explorations of geological features like dried lake basins and river tributaries suggest that liquid water once flowed across the Red Planet\u2019s landscapes billions of years ago. Furthermore, water ice has been discovered on Mars by orbiting missions like NASA\u2019s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), frequently in unexpected places.\n\nScientists believe that Mars\u2019 atmosphere was mostly stripped away and its magnetic field burnt out billions of years ago, whence Earth\u2019s magnetosphere still exists. This implied that not much could be done to stop water from evaporating and vanishing into space. Due to its thin atmosphere, modern Mars is also subjected to the sun\u2019s intense UV radiation, which is lethal to life and breaks down the intricate molecules required for it.\n\n\u201cUnlike Earth, Mars lacks a protective ozone shield, so there is 30% more harmful ultraviolet radiation at the surface in comparison with our planet,\u201d Khuller stated. \u201cThus, on Mars, the areas where photosynthesis could occur are more likely to be within dusty ice because the overlying dusty ice blocks the harmful ultraviolet radiation at Mars\u2019 surface, and liquid water is highly unstable at the surface of Mars due to its dry atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe scientists discovered through computer simulations that the shallow liquid water beneath the surface of dusty Mars ice can melt from within, shielded from evaporating into the dry Martian atmosphere by the ice covering it.\n\n\u201cSo, the two key ingredients for photosynthesis can be present within dusty Martian ice in the mid-latitudes,\u201d Khuller stated. \u201cFor photosynthesis to take place, there must be sufficient sunlight and liquid water. Previous independent models of dense Martian snow have shown that if dust particles (less than 1 percent) are present in the snow, melting below the surface can still happen in the Martian mid-latitudes today.\n\n\u201cBy discovering dusty ice exposed within buried dusty snowpacks associated with Martian gullies a few years ago, there is a mechanism for them to melt below the surface to form shallow subsurface liquid water.\u201d\n\nAccording to Khuller, the researchers discovered that the surrounding ice can shield the exposed dusty ice from the damaging UV rays that reach the surface of Mars. Additionally, enough sun energy can pass through this ice below the surface to support photosynthesis.\n\nThe concentration of dust in the ice determines the depths at which these radiative habitable zones are found. According to the team\u2019s models, ice that is very dusty would obstruct too much light. On the other hand, a radiative zone might occur in ice containing 0.01% to 0.1% dust at a depth of 2 to 15 inches (5 to 38 centimeters). At a depth of seven to ten feet (2.2 to 3.1 meters), a wider and deeper radiative zone would be possible with less \u201cpolluted\u201d ice.\n\nThe team believes that a lack of subsurface melting would make the polar regions of Mars, where most of the planet\u2019s ice is found, too cold for these radiative habitable zones to exist. The Red Planet\u2019s mid-latitude regions would be more prone to experience this kind of melting.\n\nThe observable evidence that the team has gathered comes from Earth rather than Mars, lending some credence to their theory.\n\n\u201cI was surprised to find out that there are potentially similar analogs for life within ice on Earth that contains dust and sediment,\u201d Khuller said. \u201cThese are called \u2018cryoconite holes\u2019 and form when dust and sediment on top of the ice melt into the ice because it is darker than the ice.\u201d\n\nThe study went on to say that every summer, even though the ice above is frozen, liquid water forms surrounding the black dust within the ice as a result of heating from sunshine. This occurs as a result of the ice\u2019s transparency, which lets light through below the surface.\n\n\u201cPeople have found microorganisms that live in these shallow subsurface habitats on Earth,\u201d Khuller stated. \u201cThe microorganisms typically go dormant in the winter when there is not enough sunlight to form liquid water within the dusty ice.\u201d\n\nNaturally, none of this suggests that there is or ever was photosynthetic life on Mars. However, it\u2019s exciting and might encourage more research into the possibility that the Red Planet has subterranean radiative livable zones.\n\n\u201cI am working with a team of scientists to develop improved simulations of if, where, and when dusty ice could be melting on Mars today,\u201d Khuller said. \u201cAdditionally, we are recreating some of these dusty ice scenarios in a lab setting to examine them in more detail.\u201d"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/nasa-first-interplanetary-helicopter-in-perseverance-mars-rover-belly-2020-7","domain":"businessinsider.com","published_date":"2020-08-06 19:34:37","title":"First-ever space helicopter is en route to Mars aboard NASA's rover","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5f2112b058c24d19ce45a215?width=700","content":"NASA stowed a solar-powered helicopter in the belly of its Perseverance rover, set to land on Mars on February 18.\n\nThe helicopter, called Ingenuity, aims to conduct the first-ever controlled flights on another planet.\n\nIngenuity and Perseverance will both record video as the drone flies over an ancient Martian lakebed.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today\u2019s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business \u2014 delivered daily.

A few months after landing, the rover is programmed to lower Ingenuity to the Martian surface, back away, and watch as the tiny drone carries out a series of test flights.\n\nIf successful, these will be the first controlled flights ever conducted on another planet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIngenuity is just a technological demonstration \u2014 one that has cost NASA about $85 million \u2014 but it could kick off a new approach to exploring other planets.\n\n\"In the future, it could transform how we do planetary science on these other worlds, and eventually be a scout so that we can figure out where exactly do we need to send our robots,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a press briefing before the rover's launch in July 2020.\n\nAn animation of NASA's Ingenuity helicopter exploring the Martian surface. NASA\/JPL-Caltech\n\nAs with any pioneering technology, especially in space, Ingenuity faces challenges that could undermine its mission. The helicopter's internal heaters will have to keep it warm through frigid Martian nights, when it gets as cold as negative 130 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nSince nobody has ever flown on Mars, unknown factors could thwart Ingenuity's attempts. Just last month, another pioneering Mars technology \u2014 a \"mole\" on NASA's InSight lander, meant to hammer deep into the planet's crust \u2014 was unable to complete its mission when unexpectedly thick soil stopped it in its tracks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The helicopter Ingenuity is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor,\" Matt Wallace, the Perseverance deputy project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said in a briefing last week. \"There's always going to be some probability of an issue. But that's why we're doing it. We'll learn from the issue if it occurs.\"\n\nIf Ingenuity survives and flies, here's what to expect.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe first drone footage from Mars\n\nAn artist's concept of the Ingenuity helicopter on the Martian surface. NASA\/JPL-Caltech\n\nEven for a 4-pound rotocraft like Ingenuity, the thin Martian atmosphere makes flying difficult. The air has just 1% of the density of Earth's atmosphere.\n\n\"The first and foremost challenge is to make a vehicle that's light enough to be lifted,\" MiMi Aung, who leads the helicopter project at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained in a video about the spacecraft. \"The second is to generate lift.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo catch enough air, the helicopter's four carbon-fiber blades have to spin in opposite directions at about 2,400 revolutions per minute \u2014 about eight times as fast as a passenger helicopter on Earth. To power all that spinning, solar panels on top of the spacecraft will soak up the sun's energy.\n\n\"It's a balance of a very light system, yet having enough energy that's needed to spin the rotors so fast to lift, and on top of it having to design in the autonomy,\" Aung said.\n\nBecause communicating with spacecraft on Mars takes a few minutes, ground controllers on Earth can't direct Ingenuity's flight in real time. So engineers have designed and programmed the helicopter to carry out up to five flights autonomously, within a span of 30 Martian days (roughly one Earth month).\n\nThe first flight will just test that the helicopter can get off the ground and hover about 10 feet in the air. From there, each test will be more difficult than the last, culminating in a final flight that could carry the helicopter over 980 feet (300 meters) of Martian ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo cameras on the underside of the drone will capture footage of the Martian surface below \u2014 one in color, and one in black and white.\n\nPerseverance will look on with its own cameras, allowing the helicopter and the rover to record each other.\n\n\"Imagine looking from Perseverance out at a helicopter that is flying around Perseverance, and the helicopter is looking back at Perseverance getting us images of what Perseverance is doing,\" Bridenstine said in the press briefing. \"We're going to be able to see with our own eyes, with motion pictures, these kind of activities happening on another world.

There was very little room to squeeze in a whole new machine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Kind of late in the game, we were asked to accommodate this little thing called the Mars helicopter,\" Wallace said in the pre-launch briefing. \"We had to do a little bit of a magic trick to get that one on the rover. We pulled a bit of a rabbit out of the hat.\"\n\nSince the underside of the rover had a stretch of free panel, engineers tucked the light, compact helicopter inside.\n\nLockheed Martin, one of NASA's contractors, built the system that will lower Ingenuity to the Martian ground. Around two months after it lands, Perseverance will drop the shield that covers the helicopter. The rover will then drive to whichever flat, debris-free field the mission's managers select for flying Ingenuity.\n\nAfter six days of checking out all the robot's systems, mission managers will send the signal to release the helicopter. A small electric motor, a spring-loaded arm, and a pyrotechnic device will slowly twist Ingenuity away from the rover into an upright position, then drop the drone 5 inches to the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 19-inch-tall helicopter will have about 26 inches of clearance below the rover's belly.\n\nFor now, this complex delivery system lies in wait as it travels the final miles to its destination.\n\nThis post has been updated with new information.

Innovations which will be vital in developing scalable solutions to feed a growing global population amid dwindling natural resources.\n\nThe project: Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE), spearheaded by scientists at the University of Essex, has uncovered \u2018two major photosynthetic bottlenecks\u2019 that would enable plants to realise a 27% greater yield.\n\n\u201cLike a factory line, plants are only as fast as their slowest machines,\u201d explains Patricia Lopez-Calcagno, a postdoctoral researcher at Essex, who led this work for the RIPE project. \u201cWe have identified some steps that are slower, and what we\u2019re doing is enabling these plants to build more machines to speed up these slower steps in photosynthesis.\u201d\n\nRIPE is being spearheaded by the University of Illinois to generate more productive crops through improved photosynthesis. In the study by the University of Essex team, a 27% boost was achieved. This was through a mix of adding a protein, cytochrome c6, that supports the process of converting sunlight into energy; and by applying additional cellular material from other species, to enable sugar to be made more efficiently. These \u2018hacks\u2019 also resulted in water savings.\n\n\u201cOur modeling suggests that stacking this breakthrough with two previous discoveries from the RIPE project could result in additive yield gains totaling as much as 50% to 60% in food crops,\u201d said RIPE Director Stephen Long, Ikenberry Endowed University Chair of Crop Sciences and Plant Biology at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology at Illinois.\n\nTobacco was the crop used in this study, as it easy to engineer and grow. The team will now test these new discoveries on food crops like rice, maize and soybean.\n\nTechnology outcomes from the RIPE project will be made easily accessible to farmers that need them, thanks to the Global Access model used by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n____________________________________________________"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/solarsystem.nasa.gov\/news\/1421\/arecibo-observatory-returns-from-tropical-storm-isaias-lockdown-to-track-asteroid-for-nasa\/","domain":"solarsystem.nasa.gov","published_date":"2020-08-07 17:38:24","title":"Arecibo Observatory Returns from Tropical Storm Isaias Lockdown to Track Asteroid for NASA","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/solarsystem.nasa.gov\/assets\/sse-print.png","content":"The National Science Foundation facility, managed by the University of Central Florida, determines that a newly discovered asteroid won\u2019t threaten Earth\n\nORLANDO, Aug. 6, 2020 \u2013 The Earth has one less asteroid to worry about thanks to the research of an international team of scientists at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico.\n\nRadar range-Doppler image of 2020 NK1 reveals an elongated asteroid approximately 1 km (0.6 mi) along the longest axis. The image resolution in the vertical dimension is 100 ft (30 m) per pixel.\n\nAsteroid 2020 NK1 was spotted in early July by the the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) survey team at the University of Hawaii. Little was known about the asteroid, making it difficult to predict exactly where the asteroid would travel in the future. It was estimated to be 1,600 feet in diameter, about the length of five football fields. Before the Arecibo observations, 2020 NK1 was calculated to be one of the biggest threats out of all known asteroids on NASA's list of potential impactors, with about one chance in 70,000 of impacting the Earth between 2086 and 2101.\n\nArecibo\u2019s Planetary Radar Group made it a priority to observe 2020 NK1 when it came within range \u2013 within 5 million miles \u2013 of the facility\u2019s powerful instruments. In this case, the time period was brief, July 30-31, just about the same time Tropical Storm Isaias was expected to slam into the island.\n\nThe observatory shut down to prepare for the storm, and as soon as it passed the team jumped into action to detect and study the asteroid. Even as parts of the island lost power and damage was assessed, the Arecibo team was able to determine the asteroid\u2019s shape, orbit and motion.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the storm passed quickly without damage to the telescope or the radar system, and the maintenance and electronics teams were able to activate the telescope from hurricane lockdown in time for the observations,\u201d says Sean Marshall, an observatory scientist who led the team during the radar observations.\n\nThe team of scientists and telescope operators was able to observe the asteroid for two and half hours, collecting precise measurements of the asteroid\u2019s speed and distance from Earth as well as high-resolution images of the asteroid. \u201cThese measurements greatly improve our knowledge of 2020 NK1\u2019s orbit and allow for predictions of its future whereabouts for decades to come,\u201d says Patrick Taylor, a Texas scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute, part of Universities Space Research Association, who participated in the observation remotely.\n\nThe observations showed the asteroid is not expected to get close enough to Earth to pose a danger in the future, with its closest approach coming in 2043 when it will pass about 2.25 million miles from Earth \u2013 or more than 9 times farther away than the Moon, the team concluded\n\nThe obtained radar images reveal an elongated shape and a diameter along its longest axis of approximately .6 mile.\n\n\u201cThis event was a great example of the important role that the Arecibo radar system plays in planetary science and planetary defense. It shows that we have very quick response times and high-precision range, motion, and-size measurement capabilities, in spite of storms, the COVID-19 pandemic and earthquakes with which Puerto Rico has dealt with this year,\u201d says Anne Virkki, the head of the Planetary Radar group at the Arecibo Observatory.\n\n2020 NK1 is one of many Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHO) that NASA tracks. Asteroids are considered PHOs if they are bigger than 500 feet in diameter and come within 5 million miles of the Earth\u2019s orbit. No known PHOs pose an immediate danger to the Earth, but observations like those conducted at the Arecibo Observatory are used to determine their future trajectories and risk.\n\nArecibo runs a program supported by a NASA grant to observe and characterize near-Earth objects that pose a potential hazard to Earth or that could be candidates for future space missions.\n\nThe observatory is home to the most powerful and most sensitive planetary radar system in the world, which means it is also a unique tool available to analyze NEOs, such as asteroids and comets. The knowledge gained from radar observations helps NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Coordination Office determine which objects pose significant risks, and when and what to do to mitigate them. NASA officials can also use the information to determine which objects are the most viable for science missions \u2013 landing on an asteroid is not equally easy for all of them.\n\nOther team members participating in the radar observation of 2020 NK1 were Flaviane Venditti, Israel Cabrera and Juan Marrero at Arecibo. Virkki and Dylan Hickson, also from Arecibo, participated in the data analysis.\n\nUCF manages the NSF facility under a cooperative agreement with Universidad Ana G. M\u00e9ndez and Yang Enterprises Inc. The Arecibo Planetary Radar Project is fully supported by NASA\u2019s Near Earth Object Observations Program in NASA\u2019s Planetary Defense Coordination Office through a grant awarded to UCF. Arecibo has played a role in analyzing NEOs for decades, observing up to 130 objects per year."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.timesnownews.com\/technology-science\/article\/nasa-probe-completes-final-practice-before-asteroid-sample-collection\/636376","domain":"timesnownews.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 08:30:18","title":"NASA probe completes final practice before asteroid sample collection","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/iks.timesnownews.com\/s\/v1\/img\/c_tnplaceholder.png?tr=w-600,h-450","content":"NASA probe completes final practice before asteroid sample collection | Photo Credit: IANS\n\nWashington: NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has performed its final practice before making its first attempt to grab a sample from asteroid Bennu's surface in October.\n\nDuring the practice run of the sampling sequence this week, the spacecraft reached an approximate altitude of 40 metres over sample site Nightingale before executing a back-away burn, NASA said on Wednesday.\n\n\"This rehearsal confirmed that the team and all of the spacecraft's systems are ready to collect a sample in October,\" OSIRIS-REx principal investigator Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona, Tucson, said in a statement.\n\nNightingale, OSIRIS-REx's primary sample collection site, is located within a crater in Bennu's northern hemisphere.\n\nThe approximately four-hour \"Matchpoint\" rehearsal took the spacecraft through the first three of the sampling sequence's four manoeuvres: the orbit departure burn, the \"Checkpoint\" burn and the Matchpoint burn.\n\nCheckpoint is the point where the spacecraft autonomously checks its position and velocity before adjusting its trajectory down toward the event's third manoeuvre.\n\nMatchpoint is the moment when the spacecraft matches Bennu's rotation in order to fly in tandem with the asteroid surface, directly above the sample site, before touching down on the targeted spot.\n\nFour hours after departing its 1-km safe-home orbit, OSIRIS-REx performed the Checkpoint manoeuvre at an approximate altitude of 125 metres above Bennu's surface.\n\nFrom there, the spacecraft continued to descend for another eight minutes to perform the Matchpoint burn.\n\nAfter descending on this new trajectory for another three minutes, the spacecraft reached an altitude of approximately 40 metres -- the closest the spacecraft has ever been to Bennu -- and then performed a back-away burn to complete the rehearsal.\n\nDuring the rehearsal, the spacecraft successfully deployed its sampling arm, the Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM), from its folded, parked position out to the sample collection configuration, NASA said.\n\nThis second rehearsal provided the mission team with practice navigating the spacecraft through the first three manoeuvres of the sampling event and with an opportunity to verify that the spacecraft's imaging, navigation and ranging systems operated as expected during the first part of the descent sequence.\n\nOn October 20, the spacecraft will travel all the way to the asteroid's surface during its first sample collection attempt, NASA said.\n\nDuring this event, OSIRIS-REx's sampling mechanism will touch Bennu's surface for approximately five seconds, fire a charge of pressurised nitrogen to disturb the surface and collect a sample before the spacecraft backs away.\n\nThe spacecraft is scheduled to return the sample to Earth on September 24, 2023."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.inverse.com\/innovation\/mars-with-water-map","domain":"inverse.com","published_date":"2020-08-06 16:42:00","title":"Mars map with water: incredible terraforming image shows Elon Musk\u2019s dream","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/imgix.bustle.com\/uploads\/image\/2020\/8\/10\/0bd1f7da-104b-47dd-927b-6ff548883dcd-marssachifinalwater.png?w=400&h=300&fit=crop&crop=faces&q=50&dpr=2","content":"What would Mars look like if most of its surface was covered with water?

While the left side shows a dramatic, mountainous terrain that includes Olympus Mons, the right side seems to offer more flatlands that include planes like Terra Sabaea.\n\nThe visualization has received a very warm reception. It was shared on the \"MapPorn\" subreddit on Monday, and it already ranks as the 15th-highest voted post in the community's history.\n\nBhattarai's map.

This first part shows the eastern landmass:\n\nBahttarai's visualization. Aaditya Raj Bhattarai\n\nThe second part shows the western landmass, ending with Olympus Mons:\n\nBhattarai's visualization. Aaditya Raj Bhattarai\n\nBhattarai also supplied a version of the map without water for comparison:\n\nBhattarai's map. Aaditya Raj Bhattarai\n\nTerraforming Mars is one of Musk's long-term ideas. His space-faring firm SpaceX is currently developing the Starship, a fully-reusable rocket fueled by liquid oxygen and methane. The use of this fuel means humans can travel to Mars, harvest its resources, and return home or even venture out further, creating a planet-hopping fuel network on the way. Musk is aiming to send the first humans to Mars by 2024, and build a city on the planet by 2050.\n\nBut the city is just the start. Musk has described his idea to \"nuke Mars\" and release its stores of frozen carbon dioxide, enabling humans to move around the planet with just a breathing apparatus. The proposal is bold, but Musk has clarified that in practice it would involve a continuous stream of low-fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the poles, acting as artificial suns.\n\nThe SpaceX lobby even has a before and after photo of what the planet may look like:\n\nA terraformed Mars. Steve Jurvetson\/Flickr\n\nBhattarai noted that in this map, Mars' sea level lies as low as 1,211 meters (0.75 miles) below the geoid level, a level that averages out the ocean surface by removing factors like tides and currents. The sea level also lies a staggering 20,076 meters (12.5 miles) below Olympus Mons, depicted in the image as the top-left-most black dot. Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in the solar system and measures more than double the height of Mount Everest.\n\nThe map sparked discussion about what life would be like on such a world. A Reddit user called \"Noxatrox\" asked where the best place to build an empire on the map would be. Bhattarai replied:\n\n\"Do you see that crack in the Eastern continent at north west? It is a steep cliff 6000m deep with narrow entry, like bosphoros and dardenells, also the passageway is very narrow. Would keep my capital near there.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Bhattarai flipped the image both horizontally and vertically after submitting it to Reddit. That means, in the version provided to Inverse, Bhattarai is referring to the crack in the western continent at the southeast. Reddit users noted that the previous version of the map placed the south pole at the top of the image, the reverse of traditional Earth maps.\n\nThe post even prompted other users to try their hand at making their own projections. A Reddit user called \"FlamingNinjaCat\" produced a globe version of the map using the website MaptoGlobe. Inverse used the same website to create a globe version of the modified map, accessible here.\n\nHere is how the new map looks when projected onto a globe, first with the Olympus Mons landmass:\n\nBhattarai's map on a globe. Inverse\n\nSecond with the Terra Sabaea landmass:\n\nThe map on the globe. Inverse\n\nView the legend for Bhattarai's map below:\n\nBhattarai's map legend. Aaditya Raj Bhattarai\n\nIt's perhaps a good job Mars is not covered in water just yet. The proposed sites for landing the SpaceX Starship appear to be underwater in these visualizations.\n\nUpdate 08\/10 9:45 a.m. Eastern time: The article has been amended to include an updated version of Bhattarai's map. An earlier version of this article showed a map of Mars where the sea level was 963 meters below the geoid level and 20,278 meters below Olympus Mons. Bhattarai has since provided Inverse with a map that should more accurately reflect water levels, particularly in the southern hemisphere."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/news.stv.tv\/scotland\/spacex-and-nasa-rocket-will-be-visible-in-scotlands-sky?top","domain":"news.stv.tv","published_date":"2020-05-27 19:26:31","title":"SpaceX and Nasa rocket should be visible in Scotland\u2019s sky","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/news.stv.tv\/wp-content\/themes\/stvnews\/static\/images\/fallback.png","content":"Two Nasa astronauts are on course to make history as they launch into space from US soil for the first time in nine years.\n\nPreparations are under way for Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley to travel to the International Space Station (ISS) on a rocket and capsule system built by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk\u2019s firm.\n\nIt should be possible to see the spacecraft from the UK shortly after lift-off, according to British astronaut Tim Peake.\n\nMajor Peake said the SpaceX capsule should be visible towards the west, to the right of the moon at around 9.50pm UK time.\n\nLots of people are asking about timings for tonight's spacecraft sightings.

The authors of the new paper, led by Jian Li from Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron and Diego Torres from the Institute of Space Sciences, aren\u2019t entirely sure what\u2019s going on or how the microquasar is causing the gas cloud\u2019s gamma-ray heartbeat, which pulses once every 162 days.\n\nLocated 15,000 light-years from Earth, microquasar SS 433 is one of the most fascinating places in the galaxy. It\u2019s a binary system that consists of a compact object, most likely a black hole but possibly a neutron star, and an overweight star. The presumed black hole weighs in at between 10 and 20 solar masses (in which 1 solar mass is equal to the bulk of our Sun), while the star has a mass of 30 solar masses. Stuck together, the objects spin around each other once every 13 days. SS 433 is a pint-sized version of a normal quasar, a type of cosmic object that encompasses vastly heavier black holes packed with millions of solar masses.\n\nThis celestial union generates an array of detectable ephemera in the form of gamma rays, X-rays, radio waves, and hydrogen gas. The big star is shedding much of its material onto the black hole, resulting in an intense accumulation of gases.\n\n\u201cThis material accumulates in an accretion disc before falling into the black hole, like water in the whirl above the drain of a bathtub,\u201d explained Li in a press release. \u201cHowever, a part of that matter does not fall down the drain but shoots out at high speed in two narrow jets in opposite directions above and below the rotating accretion disk.\u201d\n\nThese jets generate X-rays and gamma rays owing to the combined forces of high-speed particles and ultra-strong magnetic fields resident in the binary system. That said, the accretion disc around the black hole isn\u2019t resting perfectly flat along the orbital plane of the two objects.\n\n\u201cIt precesses, or sways, like a spinning top that has been set up slanted on a table,\u201d said Torres in the DESY release. \u201cAs a consequence, the two jets spiral into the surrounding space, rather than just forming a straight line.\u201d\n\nThis precession sways with a period lasting for 162.25 days. And as the new research shows, Fermi J1913+0515 emits a gamma-ray signal in perfect sync with the microquasar, even though it\u2019s 100 light-years away. Aside from this, there\u2019s nothing particularly special about this cloudy patch of space, but the data, collected using NASA\u2019s Fermi gamma-ray space telescope, suggests the gamma-ray heartbeat is being powered by microquasar SS 433.\n\nMaking matters even weirder, the jets from the microquasar, even with the precession, do not cross the path of Fermi J1913+0515, as Li explained in an email.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we see this observation result, and is unexpected from previously published theoretical models,\u201d he said.\n\nLi and his colleagues aren\u2019t entirely sure how the microquasar is powering the remote gas cloud, but they think protons from the equatorial outflow of SS 433 are interacting with the cloud, leading to the gamma-ray emission and observed heartbeat-like periodicity.\n\n\u201cTo maintain the coherence of the heartbeat, a magnetic tube may connect the gas cloud and SS 433,\u201d said Li in his email.\n\nhttps:\/\/gizmodo.com\/a-black-hole-collided-with-something-that-shouldnt-exis-1844134041\n\nMore observations of the objects and a new theoretical explanation to explain this unexpected finding and the hypothesized \u201cmagnetic tube\u201d would help move this work forward. One thing\u2019s for certain, however: This patch of space, located in the constellation Aquila (or Eagle), is now among the most fascinating spots in the Milky Way."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/perseids-meteor-shower-shooting-stars-stunning-photos-around-the-world\/","domain":"cbsnews.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 16:31:00","title":"Perseids meteor shower captured in stunning photos from around the world","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/08\/13\/9c2485e5-904a-4fc1-bfc3-b54634d69892\/thumbnail\/620x413\/2b0e174f52a13d805066bcc003bffe0f\/turkey.jpg?v=b241b87adbbb7f0a227ed35b96d0cefa","content":"Orionids: What to know about the fall meteor shower\n\nWhat to know about the Orionid meteor shower\n\nWhat to know about the Orionid meteor shower\n\nThe best meteor shower of the year brought with it stunning fireballs and bright trails of dust that illuminated the night sky this week.

It was section of an experiment established up to test what the telescope would capture all through a lunar eclipse, which mimics circumstances that can be utilized in the photographing of distant planets.\n\nThe critical to the experiment was ozone, the gas that safeguards all varieties of daily life from severe publicity to the sun\u2019s UV rays and is consequently observed as a required ingredient for life to exist anywhere else. Earth\u2019s ozone layer has been detected all through lunar eclipses in the previous, but generally from our facet \u2013 which means it was accompanied by distortion from other sections of the environment.\n\nThe Hubble was capable to get rid of this distortion by scanning for UV mild bouncing off the moon all through the eclipse. In accordance to the ESA, this resulted in the strongest detection ever of Earth\u2019s ozone layer.\n\nTelescopes larger sized than the Hubble are at this time in enhancement.

At the 40th ICHEP conference, the ATLAS and CMS experiments announced new results which show that the Higgs boson decays into two muons. The muon is a heavier copy of the electron, one of the elementary particles that constitute the matter content of the Universe. While electrons are classified as a first-generation particle, muons belong to the second generation. The physics process of the Higgs boson decaying into muons is a rare phenomenon as only about one Higgs boson in 5000 decays into muons. These new results have pivotal importance for fundamental physics because they indicate for the first time that the Higgs boson interacts with second-generation elementary particles.\n\nPhysicists at CERN have been studying the Higgs boson since its discovery in 2012 in order to probe the properties of this very special particle. The Higgs boson, produced from proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, disintegrates - referred to as decay - almost instantaneously into other particles. One of the main methods of studying the Higgs boson's properties is by analysing how it decays into the various fundamental particles and the rate of disintegration.\n\nCMS achieved evidence of this decay with 3 sigma, which means that the chance of seeing the Higgs boson decaying into a muon pair from statistical fluctuation is less than one in 700. ATLAS's two-sigma result means the chances are one in 40. The combination of both results would increase the significance well above 3 sigma and provides strong evidence for the Higgs boson decay to two muons.\n\n\"CMS is proud to have achieved this sensitivity to the decay of Higgs bosons to muons, and to show the first experimental evidence for this process. The Higgs boson seems to interact also with second-generation particles in agreement with the prediction of the Standard Model, a result that will be further refined with the data we expect to collect in the next run,\" said Roberto Carlin, spokesperson for the CMS experiment.\n\nThe Higgs boson is the quantum manifestation of the Higgs field, which gives mass to elementary particles it interacts with, via the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. By measuring the rate at which the Higgs boson decays into different particles, physicists can infer the strength of their interaction with the Higgs field: the higher the rate of decay into a given particle, the stronger its interaction with the field. So far, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have observed the Higgs boson decays into different types of bosons such as W and Z, and heavier fermions such as tau leptons. The interaction with the heaviest quarks, the top and bottom, was measured in 2018. Muons are much lighter in comparison and their interaction with the Higgs field is weaker. Interactions between the Higgs boson and muons had, therefore, not previously been seen at the LHC.\n\n\"This evidence of Higgs boson decays to second-generation matter particles complements a highly successful Run 2 Higgs physics programme. The measurements of the Higgs boson's properties have reached a new stage in precision and rare decay modes can be addressed. These achievements rely on the large LHC dataset, the outstanding efficiency and performance of the ATLAS detector and the use of novel analysis techniques,\" said Karl Jakobs, ATLAS spokesperson.\n\nWhat makes these studies even more challenging is that, at the LHC, for every predicted Higgs boson decaying to two muons, there are thousands of muon pairs produced through other processes that mimic the expected experimental signature. The characteristic signature of the Higgs boson's decay to muons is a small excess of events that cluster near a muon-pair mass of 125 GeV, which is the mass of the Higgs boson. Isolating the Higgs boson to muon-pair interactions is no easy feat. To do so, both experiments measure the energy, momentum and angles of muon candidates from the Higgs boson's decay. In addition, the sensitivity of the analyses was improved through methods such as sophisticated background modelling strategies and other advanced techniques such as machine-learning algorithms. CMS combined four separate analyses, each optimised to categorise physics events with possible signals of a specific Higgs boson production mode. ATLAS divided their events into 20 categories that targeted specific Higgs boson production modes.\n\nThe results, which are so far consistent with the Standard Model predictions, used the full data set collected from the second run of the LHC. With more data to be recorded from the particle accelerator's next run and with the High-Luminosity LHC, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations expect to reach the sensitivity (5 sigma) needed to establish the discovery of the Higgs boson decay to two muons and constrain possible theories of physics beyond the Standard Model that would affect this decay mode of the Higgs boson.\n\nLINKS\n\nScientific materials\n\nPapers:\n\nCMS physics analysis summary: https:\/\/cds.cern.ch\/record\/2725423\n\nATLAS paper on arXiv: https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2007.07830\n\nPhysics briefings:\n\nCMS: https:\/\/cmsexperiment.web.cern.ch\/news\/cms-sees-evidence-higgs-boson-decaying-muons\n\nATLAS: https:\/\/atlas.cern\/updates\/physics-briefing\/new-search-rare-higgs-decays-muons\n\nEvent displays and plots:\n\nCMS: https:\/\/cds.cern.ch\/record\/2720665?ln=en\n\nhttp:\/\/cds.cern.ch\/record\/2725728\n\nATLAS: https:\/\/cds.cern.ch\/record\/2725717?ln=en\n\nhttps:\/\/atlas.web.cern.ch\/Atlas\/GROUPS\/PHYSICS\/PAPERS\/HIGG-2019-14\n\nPhotos\n\nCMS detector:\n\nhttps:\/\/cds.cern.ch\/record\/1344500\/files\/0712017_02.jpg?subformat=icon-1440\n\nhttps:\/\/cds.cern.ch\/record\/1431473\/files\/bul-pho-2007-079.jpg?subformat=icon-1440\n\nATLAS detector: https:\/\/mediastream.cern.ch\/MediaArchive\/Photo\/Public\/2007\/0706038\/0706038_02\/0706038_02-A4-at-144-dpi.jpg\n\nhttps:\/\/mediastream.cern.ch\/MediaArchive\/Photo\/Public\/2007\/0705021\/0705021_01\/0705021_01-A4-at-144-dpi.jpg\n\nCMS muon system:\n\nhttps:\/\/cds.cern.ch\/record\/2016944\/files\/IMG_0267.jpg?subformat=icon-1440\n\nhttps:\/\/cds.cern.ch\/record\/1431505\/files\/DSC_1432.jpg?subformat=icon-1440\n\nATLAS muon spectrometer:\n\nhttps:\/\/mediastream.cern.ch\/MediaArchive\/Photo\/Public\/2006\/0610010\/0610010_02\/0610010_02-A4-at-144-dpi.jpg\n\nhttps:\/\/mediastream.cern.ch\/MediaArchive\/Photo\/Public\/2007\/0707043\/0707043_01\/0707043_01-A4-at-144-dpi.jpg"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.teslarati.com\/spacex-starlink-satellite-production-details-2020\/","domain":"teslarati.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 20:23:44","title":"SpaceX building almost 1500 Starlink satellites per year","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.teslarati.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Starlink-V1-L8-Falcon-9-B1059-LC40-061220-Richard-Angle-prelaunch-6-crop-c.jpg","content":"By\n\nSpaceX has revealed a few key details about its burgeoning Starlink satellite internet constellation in a recent regulatory presentation, touching on overall investment, user terminal development, and its spacecraft manufacturing capabilities.\n\nAlready the single largest satellite constellation in the world by a factor of three or more, Starlink is more than 500 operational satellites strong after just nine months of launches, and the company has at least 5-8 more missions planned between now and the end of 2020. To further expand the world\u2019s largest satellite constellation, though, SpaceX also needs to be the world\u2019s most prolific satellite manufacturer by at least an order of magnitude.\n\nEver since SpaceX\u2019s first dedicated Starlink launch in May 2019, the company has remained extremely secretive about the unprecedented satellite production infrastructure it also had to develop. Aside from a few comments by CEO Elon Musk and the occasional tidbit from regulatory documents or spaceflight conferences, very little is known and not a single photo has been released. An FCC ex parte presentation with a few specific details thus came as a surprise, revealing that SpaceX is building at least 120 Starlink satellites per month in its Redmond, Washington factory.\n\nSpaceX told the FCC in a late July presentation that the company\u2019s Starlink unit is \u201cnow building 120 satellites per month\u201d and has \u201cinvested over $70 million developing and producing thousands of consumer user terminals per month.\u201d pic.twitter.com\/DJi1uIaw3l \u2014 Michael Sheetz (@thesheetztweetz) August 7, 2020\n\nA stack of 60 Starlink v1.0 satellites. (SpaceX)\n\nBased on past analysis of SpaceX\u2019s Redmond facilities, the company has about 150,000 square feet (14,000 m^2) to work with, of which a third to half is likely dedicated to a satellite assembly line. Despite the relatively small facilities, SpaceX says it is actively building 120 satellites per month \u2013 equivalent to at least 1440 spacecraft annually. By mass, it means that SpaceX is churning out more than 30 metric tons (~69,000 lb) of satellites every single month, a figure almost certainly unprecedented in the history of satellite manufacturing.\n\nAn animation of SpaceX\u2019s Starlink satellite constellation. (SpaceX)\n\nSustained over 12 months, that would equate to ~360 metric tons (10% heavier than a fully-fueled Falcon 9 V1.0 rocket) of satellites built every year. In short, with an extremely small (and thus efficient) base of operations, SpaceX is regularly producing a vast quantity of satellites \u2013 enough to indefinitely sustain two full Starlink launches per month. At that rate, SpaceX could fairly easily complete the Starlink constellation\u2019s first ~4400-satellite phase in just three years.\n\nProduction capacity or efficiency would need to expand significantly for SpaceX to complete the second (~12,000 satellites) and third (~40,000 satellites) phases of the Starlink constellation, By then, though, the first phase would likely be generating substantial revenue, optimistically allowing SpaceX to self-fund future growth or at least dramatically reducing the need for fundraising.\n\nJust a few of the eight Starlink launches SpaceX has completed in 2020 alone. (SpaceX)\n\nAlong those lines, the same FCC ex parte presentation included a note that \u201cSpaceX has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in Starlink to date,\u201d including \u201cover $70 million developing and producing thousands of user terminals per month.\u201d In other words, SpaceX has apparently spent less \u2013 and possibly much less \u2013 than $1 billion designing, manufacturing, and launching almost 600 satellites. For comparison, competitor OneWeb apparently spent more than $3.4 billion and filed for bankruptcy before it had launched even 100 satellites.\n\nThat exceptional efficiency will, as CEO Elon Musk has noted several times, hopefully make Starlink the first low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite internet constellation in history to not go bankrupt. The company hopes to begin rolling out a much wider Starlink beta test after the 14th v1.0 satellite launch \u2013 currently four launches away. If all goes well during that beta test, Starlink could become the first LEO internet constellation in history to begin generating significant revenue not long after.\n\nCheck out Teslarati\u2019s Marketplace!

A new study led by the University of Zurich has now shown that the creature lived in water and was surprisingly adaptable.\n\nFor over 150 years, paleontologists have puzzled over Tanystropheus, its strangely long neck and whether it lived mostly underwater or on land. An international team led by the University of Zurich has now reconstructed its skull in unprecedented detail using synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR\u03bcCT), an extremely powerful form of CT scanning. In addition to revealing crucial aspects of its lifestyle, this also shows that Tanystropheus had evolved into two different species.\n\nUnderwater ambush predator\n\nThe researchers were able to reconstruct an almost complete 3D skull from a severely crushed fossil. The reconstruction reveals that the skull of Tanystropheus has several very clear adaptations for life in water. The nostrils are located on the top of the snout, much like in modern crocodilians, and the teeth are long and curved, perfectly adapted for catching slippery prey like fish and squid. However, the lack of visible adaptations for swimming in the limbs and tail also means that Tanystropheus was not a particularly efficient swimmer. \u201cIt likely hunted by stealthily approaching its prey in murky water using its small head and very long neck to remain hidden,\u201d says lead author and UZH paleontologist Stephan Spiekman.\n\nTwo species living together\n\nTanystropheus remains have mainly been found at Monte San Giorgio on the border between Switzerland and Italy, a place so unique for its Triassic fossils that it has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Two types of Tanystropheus fossils are known from this location, one small and one large. Until now, these were believed to be the juveniles and adults of the same species.\n\nHowever, the current study disproves this assumption. The reconstructed skull, belonging to a large specimen, is very different from the already known smaller skulls, particularly when it comes to its dentition. In order to see whether the small fossils actually belonged to young animals, the researchers looked at cross sections of limb bones from the smaller type of Tanystropheus. They found many growth rings which form when bone growth is drastically slowed down. \u201cThe number and distribution of the growth rings tells us that these smaller types were not young animals, as previously considered, but mature ones,\u201d says last author Torsten Scheyer. \u201cThis means that the small fossils belonged to a separate, smaller species of Tanystropheus.\u201d\n\nSpecialists in different food sources\n\nAccording to Spiekman, these two closely related species had evolved to use different food sources in the same environment: \u201cThe small species likely fed on small shelled animals, like shrimp, in contrast to the large species which ate fish and squid.\u201d For the researchers, this is a really remarkable finding: \u201cWe expected the bizarre neck of Tanystropheus to be specialized for a single task, like the neck of a giraffe.

This is the first time that this technique is successfully employed with observations obtained at radio wavelengths.\n\nFor their observations, the researchers used a network of radio antennas that are linked together to form a continent-size radio telescope. The discovery was possible thanks to the extremely high precision measurements of the star\u2019s position that can only be achieved with such a radio telescope network.\n\nOne of the things that makes this detection exciting is that the planet, called TVLM 513b, has a similar mass to Saturn and an orbit analogous to that of Mercury in our Solar System. Only a handful of extrasolar planets with characteristics similar to TVLM 513b have been discovered so far around small, cool stars \u2013 known as ultracool dwarfs.\n\nOther planet search techniques have difficulties to study these dwarfs, mainly due to the faintness of the objects, which makes radio observations a very powerful and complementary tool to uncover many more new planets.\n\nThe results are published in the current issue of the Astronomical Journal (\"An astrometric planetary companion candidate to the M9 Dwarf TVLM 513-46546\").\n\nIllustration of the planetary system TVLM 513\u201346546; the newly discovered Saturn-like planet is seen in front of its host star, a small and cool brown dwarf. (Image: Luis A. Curiel Ramirez)\n\nUsing the supersharp radio \"vision\" of the continent-wide Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), astronomers have discovered a Saturn-sized planet closely orbiting a small, cool star 35 light-years from Earth. This is the first discovery of an extrasolar planet with a radio telescope using a technique that requires extremely precise measurements of a star's position in the sky, and only the second planet discovery for that technique and for radio telescopes.\n\nThe technique has long been known, but has proven difficult to use. It involves tracking the star's actual motion in space, then detecting a minuscule \"wobble\" in that motion caused by the gravitational effect of the planet. The star and the planet orbit a location that represents the center of mass for both combined. The planet is revealed indirectly if that location, called the barycenter, is far enough from the star's center to cause a wobble detectable by a telescope.\n\nThis technique, called the astrometric technique, is expected to be particularly good for detecting Jupiter-like planets in orbits distant from the star. This is because when a massive planet orbits a star, the wobble produced in the star increases with a larger separation between the planet and the star, and at a given distance from the star, the more massive the planet, the larger the wobble produced.\n\nStarting in June of 2018 and continuing for a year and a half, the astronomers tracked a star called TVLM 513\u201346546, a cool dwarf with less than a tenth the mass of our Sun in the constellation Bo\u00f6tes (The Herdsman). In addition, they used data from nine previous VLBA observations of the star between March 2010 and August 2011.\n\nExtensive analysis of the data from those time periods revealed a telltale wobble in the star's motion indicating the presence of a planet comparable in mass to Saturn, orbiting the star once every 221 days. This planet is closer to the star than Mercury is to the Sun.\n\nSmall, cool stars like TVLM 513\u201346546 are the most numerous stellar type in our Milky Way Galaxy, and many of them have been found to have smaller planets, comparable to Earth and Mars.\n\n\"Giant planets, like Jupiter and Saturn, are expected to be rare around small stars like this one, and the astrometric technique is best at finding Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits, so we were surprised to find a lower mass, Saturn-like planet in a relatively compact orbit. We expected to find a more massive planet, similar to Jupiter, in a wider orbit\", said Salvador Curiel, of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \u201cDetecting the orbital motions of this sub-Jupiter mass planetary companion in such a compact orbit was a great challenge\u201d, he added.\n\nMore than 4,300 planets have been discovered orbiting stars other than the Sun, but the planet around TVLM 513\u201346546 is only the second to be found using the astrometric technique. Another, very successful method, called the radial velocity technique, also relies on the gravitational effect of the planet upon the star. That technique detects the slight acceleration of the star, either toward or away from Earth, caused by the star's motion around the barycenter.\n\n\"Our method complements the radial velocity method which is more sensitive to planets orbiting in close orbits, while ours is more sensitive to massive planets in orbits further away from the star\", said Gisela Ortiz-Leon of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Germany. \"Indeed, these other techniques have found only a few planets with characteristics such as planet mass, orbital size, and host star mass, similar to the planet we found. We believe that the VLBA, and the astrometry technique in general, could reveal many more similar planets.\"\n\nA third technique, called the transit method, also very successful, detects the slight dimming of the star's light when a planet passes in front of it, as seen from Earth.\n\nThe astrometric method has been successful for detecting nearby binary star systems, and was recognized as early as the 19th Century as a potential means of discovering extrasolar planets. Over the years, a number of such discoveries were announced, then failed to survive further scrutiny. The difficulty has been that the stellar wobble produced by a planet is so small when seen from Earth that it requires extraordinary precision in the positional measurements."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.lintelligencer.com\/nasa-a-safe-splashdown-for-an-historic-test-flight-on-this-week-5665-2020\/","domain":"lintelligencer.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 21:00:00","title":"NASA: A Safe Splashdown for an Historic Test Flight on This Week","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/lintelligencer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/banner1.jpg","content":"The #LaunchAmerica mission aboard SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon \u201cEndeavour\u201d spacecraft that brought NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley back to Earth marked the first splashdown of an American crew spacecraft in 45 years.

Pictured is an artist impression of a magnestar\n\nKnown as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), signals such as this have baffled scientists for years and typically originate from far beyond the Milky Way.\n\nTheir origins are unknown.

Here's what you need to know... FRBs, or fast radio bursts, are a mysterious space phenomenon\n\nThey're very quick radio bursts that last just a few milliseconds (or thousandths of seconds)\n\nThey're detected as huge spikes of energy that change in strength over time\n\nThe first one was discovered back in 2007, found by looking back through space survey data\n\nLots of FRBs have been found since then\n\nThere's also one FRB source that is sending out repeated bursts \u2013 and no one is quite sure why\n\nIn fact, scientists have struggled to explain exactly what causes any FRB in the first place\n\nTheories include rapidly rotating neutron stars, black holes, and even alien life\n\nFRBs are important simply because they're so baffling to experts\n\nUnlocking the secrets of what causes them will give us a much better understanding of what goes on beyond our galaxy\n\nAnd if it does turn out that some other life-form is causing these FRBs, it would be a world-changing discovery\n\nThough the evidence now points strongly in favour of magnestars being the source of all FRBs, the study is not conclusive.\n\nIt's possible other stellar phenomena may also lead to the eruption of the mysterious signals.\n\nThat could mean the dying embers of a huge star, black holes, or something never before detected by humans.\n\nAt least one scientist has suggested the signals could be produced by alien spaceships. However, the majority of experts disagree with this theory.\n\nWhatever their origins, FRBs have the potential to be a new tool that we can use to understand the structure of matter in the universe.\n\nThe radio bursts were first discovered in 2007, so small even steps toward understanding their source offers big excitement for astronomers.\n\nScientist Seth Shostak from the SETI Institutes explains what Fast Radio Bursts are\n\nIn other news, astronomers have spotted the Moon flashing at us \"over and over\".\n\nBabies born today will see the first \"self-sustaining human colony\" on Mars.\n\nAnd, scientists have failed to find alien life in scans of 1,300 stars \u2013 but say they\u2019re not giving up yet.\n\nDo you think there is intelligent life out in the universe?

V745 Sco is a binary star system that consists of a red giant star and a white dwarf locked together by gravity. These two stellar objects orbit so closely around one another that the outer layers of the red giant are pulled away by the intense gravitational force of the white dwarf. This material gradually falls onto the surface of the white dwarf. Over time, enough material may accumulate on the white dwarf to trigger a colossal thermonuclear explosion, causing a dramatic brightening of the binary called a nova. Astronomers saw V745 Sco fade by a factor of a thousand in optical light over the course of about 9 days.\n\nIn 2014, astronomers finally got their chance to see the phenomena, using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. Their key finding was it appeared that most of the material ejected by the explosion was moving towards us and developed a 3-D computer model of the explosion that explained the observations.

This has limited fluorescents' overall use.\n\nChemists reports in a new study that this decades-long challenge is finally coming to the end thanks to a newly discovered class of materials called SMILES (small-molecule ionic isolation lattices), along with specialized scaffolding molecule. SMILES, the study suggests, are the brightest known material in existence.\n\nThe finding, published Thursday in the journal Chem, focuses on solving a familiar and resilient problem facing fluorescents called \"quenching.\" Essentially, when multiple dyes are combined together to form a solid, they can't help but interact with each other, which lowers their fluorescence.\n\nAmar Flood, a chemist at Indiana University and co-senior author, explains that this process can be compared to the way children behave when sat together and told to be quiet or still.\n\n\"The problem of quenching and inter-dye coupling emerges when the dyes stand shoulder-to-shoulder inside solids,\" says Flood. \"They cannot help but 'touch' each other. Like young children sitting at storytime, they interfere with each other and stop behaving as individuals.\"\n\nResearch in the past has found ways to keep these mischievous dyes separate from each other, but not without adding artificial colors to the solid and compromising the overall photonic qualities of the fluorescent dye. Flood and his colleagues write that their approach is unique because it uses a colorless molecule to keep these dyes separate, maintaining their fidelity\n\nIn turn, this process could give new life to over 100,000 dyes for applications in biomedical imaging, solar energy, and more, the study suggests.\n\n(Left) the 3D printed fluorescent objects under white light versus (right) the objects under UV light. Amar Flood \/ Chem\n\nHow it works \u2014 The trick to achieving this, write the authors, was using a colorless molecule called a cyanostar to give added structure to these chatty dyes.\n\nThe cyanostar kept the dyes from mixing as they set. This maintained their precious optical qualities and enabled them to transform into a lattice of separated molecules which the team dubbed SMILES.\n\nThey were then able to grow these SMILES into crystals and transform them into a powder that could be spun into a thin film and directly incorporated into a polymer. When the polymers were used to print 3D objects, such as abstract lattice cages seen in the photographs above, the researchers found that the dyes not only maintained their optical properties in solid form but were also the brightest materials known in existence.\n\n\"We also do not know the materials' limits.\"\n\nThis is more of a technicality \u2014 it doesn't necessarily mean they'll appear bright to the human eye, Flood and co-author Bo Laursen tell Inverse.\n\n\"Since fluorescence is reemission of absorbed light the perceived brightness (by human eyes) will depend on our perception of the light used to excite the material,\" the authors explained over email. \"Fluorescence can be extremely bright when only UV light is used, in that case, the material appears as a true intrinsic light source (since human eyes cannot detect UV light).\"\n\nInstead, it can be better to compare the brightness between two different materials, say the authors. In this case, when comparing their material to one with similar glowing properties, cadmium selenide quantum dots used for medical diagnosis, the SMILES material was 30 times brighter.\n\nThis approach was also successfully applied to a number of major commercial dyes without any additional adjustments, a \"plug-and-play\" approach that may offer an important generalizable solution for researchers handling a vast catalog of dyes.\n\nWhat's next \u2014 Despite the promising results of this initial study, the researchers caution that it is only a first step towards realizing the full potential of these dyes.\n\n\"These materials are totally new, so we do not know which of their innate properties are actually going to offer superior functionality,\" Flood says. \"We also do not know the materials' limits. So, we will develop a fundamental understanding of how they work, providing a robust set of design rules for making new properties. This is critical for putting these materials into the hands of others -- we want to pursue crowdsourcing and to work with others in this effort.\"\n\nFlood and Laursen tell Inverse that this won't be a magic fix, but that it could have major implications for existing fluorescent technologies. They anticipate SMILES will benefit the worlds of solar technology, medical diagnostics, lasers, and drug development.\n\n\"This will not solve the Covid-19 or climate challenge, but may ... contribute in the long run,\" the authors explain.\"We expect many areas using fluorescence technology to benefit from this new material.\"\n\nAbstract: Fluorescence is critical to applications in optical materials including OLEDs and photonics. While fluorescent dyes are potential key components of thesematerials, electronic coupling between them in the solid state quenches their emission, preventing their reliable translation to applications. We report a universal solution to this longstanding problem with the discovery of a class of materials called small-molecule ionic isolation lattices (SMILES). SMILES perfectly transfer the optical properties of dyes to solids, are simple to make by mixing cationic dyes with anion-binding cyanostar macrocycles, and work with major classes of commercial dyes, including xanthenes, oxazines, styryls, cyanines, and trianguleniums. Dyes are decoupled spatially and electronically in the lattice by using cyanostar with its wide band gap. Toward applications, SMILES crystals have the highest known brightness per volume and solve concentration quenching to impart fluorescence to commercial polymers. SMILES materials enable predictable fluorophore crystallization to fulfill the promise of optical materials by design."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.sentinelassam.com\/international\/spacex-crew-dragon-returns-with-two-nasa-astronauts-493136","domain":"sentinelassam.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 08:23:27","title":"SpaceX Crew Dragon returns with two NASA astronauts - Sentinelassam","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/media.assettype.com\/english-sentinelassam%2Fimport%2Fh-upload%2F2020%2F08%2F04%2F149284-nasa.webp?w=480&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max","content":"WASHINGTON: Two NASA astronauts have safely returned to Earth from the International Space Station onboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, marking the completion of a historic flight called demonstration (Demo-2) mission.

This means that the well-traveled artifact could soon be visiting the Moon or perhaps even Mars!\n\nThe Crew Dragon astronauts brought back a flag taken to the ISS by the last space shuttle mission in 2011 (Credit: NASA)\n\nWith the final test flight complete, NASA will spend the next few weeks analyzing performance data from the Falcon 9 rocket, the Crew Dragon spacecraft, and ground systems, as well as in-orbit, docking, splashdown, and recovery operations. If everything is satisfactory, SpaceX will become the first private company to be certified to transport astronauts to the ISS.\n\nIn anticipation of the pending approval, SpaceX is already preparing for its first two operational missions. Crew-1 will launch in late September 2020, with NASA astronauts Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, and Shannon Walker and Japan's Soichi Noguchi on board for a six-month stint at the ISS.\n\nBob Behnken's wife, NASA astronaut Megan McArthur, will be heading to the ISS for the first time in spring 2021.

While the veteran scientist did serve as a Mission Specialist aboard STS-125, the final space shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, this will be her first visit to the ISS and, of course, the first trip on the Crew Dragon spacecraft. But given that her spouse has done both, she has little to worry about.\n\n\"Of course, I'll have a lot of tips for her,\" Behnken said. \"A lot of them will be about how life on space station goes. I think that's been the thing that's been more unique, rather than the capsule itself. I think that's probably where I'll have the most to share with her, but I definitely have some advice about living inside of Dragon.\"\n\nResources: Space.com, NASA.gov, theverge.com"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/science\/dinosaur-diagnosed-malignant-cancer-first-time-report","domain":"foxnews.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 10:08:08","title":"Dinosaur diagnosed with malignant cancer for the first time: researchers say","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/896\/500\/centrosauruses.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","content":"Researchers on Monday announced the discovery and diagnosis of an aggressive type of bone cancer in a dinosaur, making it the first known example of a dinosaur afflicted by malignant cancer, according to a study.\n\nThe cancer was found in the leg bone of a Centrosaurus, a horned dinosaur that lived 76 to 77 million years ago. Its fossils were previously unearthed in the badlands of Dinosaur Provincial Park in Canada\u2019s Alberta province back in 1989, where scientists spotted a badly malformed leg bone they believed to be a healed fracture.\n\nA team of researchers, including David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) and Mark Crowther a hematologist at McMaster University, re-evaluated the bone and determined it was actually osteosarcoma, an aggressive type of bone cancer, according to a study published the journal Lancet Oncology.\n\nWORLD'S SMALLEST DINOSAUR IS NO MORE: 2-INCH CREATURE LIKELY A LIZARD INSTEAD\n\n\u201cDiagnosis of aggressive cancer like this in dinosaurs has been elusive and requires medical expertise and multiple levels of analysis to properly identify,\u201d Crowther said in a press release by the ROM. \u201cHere, we show the unmistakable signature of advanced bone cancer in 76-million-year-old horned dinosaur -- the first of its kind. It\u2019s very exciting.\u201d\n\nEvans said the lower leg bone contained \u201ca massive gnarly tumor larger than an apple.\"\n\nThe researchers -- assembled from a variety of different fields -- diagnosed the tumor using high-resolution CT scans, where they observed thin sections under the microscope to assess it at a cellular level.\n\nScientists approached the diagnosis similar to how they would with an unknown tumor in a human patient.\n\n\u201cWe were not only able to demonstrate that the bone tissue showed the hallmarks of osteosarcoma, but that the tumor spiraled through the cortex of bone, discounting its original identification of a healed fracture,\u201d Evans added.\n\nMost tumors occur in soft tissue that doesn't willingly fossilize, so there is little evidence of cancer in fossil records, according to Reuters.\n\nBIZARRE 'CAPTAIN HOOK' DINOSAUR WITH LONG CLAWS DISCOVERED IN MONTANA BADLANDS\n\nThe study's findings could establish links between ancient and modern animals and even help scientists learn more about the evolution and genetics of various diseases.\n\n\"Evidence of many other diseases that we share with dinosaurs and other extinct animals may yet be sitting in museum collections in need of re-examination using modern analytical techniques,\" the release said.\n\nTumors were also found in a dinosaur earlier this year, although a malignant cancer diagnosis has yet to be confirmed.\n\n\u201cThis finding speaks to the biology of cancer. It is not something novel or new, but probably has occurred since time immemorial and is an expected complication in all animals,\u201d added Crowther, according to the news organization.\n\n\u201cOsteosarcoma generally occurs in rapidly growing bones and as such is found in children and young adults. Presumably, dinosaurs were also at risk because of the fact that they grew at enormous rates,\u201d he continued.\n\nWhile the Centrosaurus was likely weak from cancer before it died, Evans said the disease may not have killed the dinosaur. The fossil was found in a bonebed containing the remains of hundreds of other Centrosaurus dinosaurs, which suggested that they died in a flood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThis remarkable find shows that no matter how big or powerful some dinosaurs may seem, they were affected by many of the same diseases we see in humans and other animals today, including cancer,\" he added, according to Reuters. \"Dinosaurs seem like mythical beasts, but they were living, breathing animals that suffered through horrible injuries and diseases.\""},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/tribune.com.pk\/story\/2259001\/dwarf-planet-ceres-is-ocean-world-with-salty-water-deep-underground","domain":"tribune.com.pk","published_date":"2020-08-11 05:30:40","title":"Dwarf planet Ceres is 'ocean world' with salty water deep underground","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.tribune.com.pk\/media\/images\/22121597123609-0\/22121597123609-0.jpg","content":"Occator Crater and Ahuna Mons appear together in this view of the dwarf planet Ceres obtained by NASA's Dawn spacecraft on February 11, 2017.

The scientists focused on the 57-mile-wide (92-km-wide) Occator Crater, formed by an impact about 22 million years ago in Ceres\u2019 northern hemisphere. It has two bright areas - salt crusts left by liquid that percolated up to the surface and evaporated.\n\nThe liquid, they concluded, originated in a brine reservoir hundreds of miles (km) wide lurking about 25 miles (40 km) below the surface, with the impact creating fractures allowing the salty water to escape.\n\nThe research was published in the journals Nature Astronomy, Nature Geoscience, and Nature Communications.\n\nIndian food delivery company introduces 'period leave' for employees\n\nOther solar system bodies beyond Earth where subsurface oceans are known or appear to exist include Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa, Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus, Neptune\u2019s moon Triton and the dwarf planet Pluto.\n\nWater is considered a key ingredient for life.

All around the country temperatures have often exceeded 30C in the weeks passed. London, for example, has seen the longest stretch of high temperatures in almost six decades.\n\nTrending\n\nThe Met Office said temperatures exceeded 34C in the city for the sixth day in a row - the first time that has happened since at least 1961. Parts of South Wales and the South West experienced similar temperatures for prolonged periods. No sooner had the heatwave started than awe-inspiring thunderstorms engulfed much of the country on Thursday. Many have quietly warned that the polar extremes in the weather are a sign of things to come as the effects of climate change and global warming become more visible.\n\nUK heatwave: A warmer climate may bring with it new tropical diseases like dengue fever\n\nDengue fever: A patient is treated for the disease in India\n\nHeat and thunderstorms, however, aren't the only things that will accompany climate change. Disease more common in countries with tropical climates along the equator will now, experts warn, begin to make their way into territories that had hitherto proved uninhabitable, like the UK. In 2015, Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust warned The Observer that his real fear as the UK warmed was increases in instances of dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease that causes fever, headache, and \u2013 on occasions \u2013 dangerous drops in blood pressure, and about 2.5 percent of cases prove fatal. He explained: \u201cBefore 1970 only seven countries had experienced serious dengue outbreaks.

It said that, as mosquitoes thrive in warm and wet environments, a rise in temperature \"could make the UK a more attractive destination\u201d. It goes on to say that \"this could then lead to an increase in three diseases \u2013 malaria, dengue fever and chikungunya (a viral infection with symptoms similar to malaria) \u2013 in the UK by as early as 2030\u201d. The UK is already home to more than 30 native mosquito species, none of which carry disease.\n\nClimate change: The graph shows the extent to which the Earth has warmed since 1880\n\nWith rising global temperatures, humidity and spreading urbanisation are the specific drivers of the dengues spread. This is, Mr Farrar explained, because it is transmitted by the Aedes genus mosquito, which likes heat and has become urban-adapted. The warnings are hypothetical and may be thwarted should the global community pull together to reduce the severity of climate change. Presently, however, communities up and down the country are working to alleviate the damage caused by severe storms after the heatwave.\n\nStonehaven: The adverse weather results in a landslide and a train derailment near Stonehaven"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/dronedj.com\/2020\/08\/17\/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-gets-first-boot-in-space\/","domain":"dronedj.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 13:01:00","title":"NASA\u2019s Ingenuity Mars helicopter gets first boot in space","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/dronedj.com\/wp-content\/themes\/ninetofive\/dist\/images\/default-dronedj-related-guide.png?w=1600","content":"NASA\u2018s Mars helicopter Ingenuity successfully powered on and charged its batteries marking the first time the helicopter has been powered on in space. The batteries were charged to 35%, an optimal level to keep the batteries healthy during the journey to Mars.\n\nEarlier this month NASA\u2019s Ingenuity Mars helicopter received an evaluation and recharge of its power system one week after it took off with the Perseverance rover. The helicopter\u2019s batteries were able to be charged for the first time in space.\n\nIt took around eight hours for the six lithium-ion batteries to be charged. The team had to monitor the process as the helicopter slowly charged to 35%, a number deemed to be best to keep the batteries healthy along the almost seven month-long journey to Mars.\n\nTim Canham, the operations lead for Mars Helicopter at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) said:\n\n\u201cThis was a big milestone, as it was our first opportunity to turn on Ingenuity and give its electronics a \u2018test drive\u2019 since we launched on July 30. Since everything went by the book, we\u2019ll perform the same activity about every two weeks to maintain an acceptable state of charge.\u201d\n\nMiMi Aung, the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter project manager at JPL followed up with:\n\n\u201cThis charge activity shows we have survived launch and that so far we can handle the harsh environment of interplanetary space. We have a lot more firsts to go before we can attempt the first experimental flight test on another planet, but right now we are all feeling very good about the future.\u201d\n\nIngenuity helicopter\n\nThe helicopter, Ingenuity, will allow NASA to get a new look at the planet from above. Much like a drone on Earth, the helicopter will allow scientists to capture high-definition images to better prepare for future missions where a rover or human might land.\n\nThe key objectives NASA has set out to fulfill with the Ingenuity helicopter are to demonstrate powered flight in the thin Mars atmosphere, demonstrate miniaturized flying technology on another planet, and finally get the helicopter to operate autonomously.\n\nThese might sound easy to do on Earth, but to do them on Mars is another thing. Mars has an atmosphere that is only 1% as thick as the Earth\u2019s, making it hard to generate lift. On top of that, the thin atmosphere has forced the NASA team to keep the drone fairly light at around 4 pounds.\n\nThe helicopter will be able to fly as high as 15 feet and as far as 160 feet with the longest flight duration being 90 seconds. To keep itself in the air, Ingenuity spins its propellers between 2000 and 3000 rpms. It also comes equipped with a solar panel to charge itself back up, onboard flight computers, navigation sensors, a color camera, and a black and white camera.\n\nAs the helicopter is too far away to be controlled with a joystick, engineers will have to learn how to fly it with the control delay, but eventually have hopes for it to fly, land, communicate, manage its energy, and keep warm autonomously.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Eventually all those digital bits will actually outnumber all the atoms on Earth, according to one theoretical physicist.\n\n\"We are literally changing the planet bit by bit and it is an invisible crisis,\" Melvin Vopson, who lectures at the University of Portsmouth in the UK, said in a release.\n\nVopson isn't just talking about how all our digital technology uses up natural resources and creates planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, although he notes that is happening too. Instead, he calculates that as the amount of digital bits we create continues to grow, they could actually outnumber the total atoms on Earth as soon as 2170 (assuming a 50% annual growth rate in digital bits created).\n\n\"The growth of digital information seems truly unstoppable,\" Vopson said. \"According to IBM and other big data research sources, 90% of the world's data today has been created in the last 10 years alone. In some ways, the current COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process as more digital content is used and produced than ever before.\"\n\nVopson is the author of a newly published paper titled The Information Catastrophe appearing Tuesday in the journal AIP Advances.\n\nVopson wants to experimentally verify that information bits have mass, which he extrapolated to forecast in 225 years will be half of Earth's mass. Melvin Vopson\n\nYou might think he's envisioning a future in which we've stripped away part of the Earth's crust to create massive server farms and burned the rest of its mass to power them. But beyond the energy and resource depletion implications, Vopson also draws on a theory he formulated in 2019 that postulates information as a fifth state of matter.\n\n\"In fact, it was proposed that \"information\" is not only the fifth form of matter along solid, liquid, gas, and plasma but also possibly the dominant form of matter in the universe,\" he writes.\n\nThe idea builds upon the work of Einstein and later scientists. Over the years, some have gone so far as to try to calculate the mass of a bit of information.\n\nBy Vopson's calculations, the total mass of all the information we produce in a year is far less than a single grain of rice, or about equal to one E. Coli bacterium. But it's the potential for growth that concerns Vopson. In an extreme scenario where the amount of digital information grows by 50% annually, half of our planet's mass could be literally converted to bits within 225 years.\n\n\"In this context, assuming the planetary power limitations are solved, one could envisage a future world mostly computer simulated and dominated by digital bits and computer code,\" his paper concludes.\n\nIt's worth noting that IDC estimates (using different and more recent data than Vopson) that the amount of data created annually is even higher and IDC estimates the annual growth rate over the next few years to be around 26%.\n\nThat would make the 2245 scenario Vopson describes seem perhaps not as far-off and extreme.\n\nHowever, David Wolpert, a physicist at the Santa Fe Institute isn't too worried about a looming information catastrophe.\n\n\"This article considers some interesting physics issues, but since the timescales are centuries, one has to worry about the economics aspect,\" he writes via email.\n\nWolpert offers a cheeky example to illustrate his concern with Vopson's logic:\n\n\"To follow in [Vopson's] spirit, the global woman's lingerie market is expanding at an ~ 9.4% annual rate... Extrapolating that to 500 years in the future -- as the authors of the article do for a different commodity -- we arrive at a figure of $3 x 10^19 US$, which would obviously ruin the world's economy (and most likely the ecosystem). The conclusion, clearly, is that we are headed for a lingerie catastrophe.\"\n\nStill, while Vopson's ideas about information as matter have yet to be proven through experimentation, it remains worthwhile to consider just how fast our digital society is growing and at what long term costs to not just the environment, but the actual planet down to its very crust."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/08\/12\/uk\/new-dinosaur-species-southampton-intl-hnk-scli-scn\/index.html","domain":"cnn.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 06:43:00","title":"New dinosaur species related to Tyrannosaurus rex discovered by scientists in England","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/200812133839-01-dinosaur-discovery-southampton.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1022,w_1817,c_fill\/w_1280","content":"CNN \u2014\n\nA new species of dinosaur related to the Tyrannosaurus rex has been discovered in England.\n\nPaleontologists at the University of Southampton have spent months studying four bones that were found last year in the village of Shanklin, on the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England.\n\nThey finally determined that the bones were from the neck, back and tail of a new dinosaur \u201cpreviously unknown to science,\u201d according to a release from the university.\n\nThe dinosaur would have measured about 4 meters (about 13 feet) long, and is a type of theropod dinosaur \u2013 a group of carnivores that typically walked on two legs instead of four, which includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. It lived in the Cretaceous period, about 115 million years ago, according to the release.\n\nScientists named the dinosaur Vectaerovenator inopinatus \u2013 a name that refers to large air sacs in some of the bones, which are commonly seen in theropods, and which helped the researchers identify the species. The sacs are also seen in modern birds; they likely helped create an efficient breathing system in these dinosaurs, while also making the skeleton lighter.\n\nTwo of the four bones that were discovered last year, determined to belong to the Vectaerovenator inopinatus. University of Southampton\n\n\u201cWe were struck by just how hollow this animal was \u2013 it\u2019s riddled with air spaces. Parts of its skeleton must have been rather delicate,\u201d said Chris Barker, a PhD student at the university who led the study. \u201cThe record of theropod dinosaurs from the mid Cretaceous period in Europe isn\u2019t that great, so it\u2019s been really exciting to be able to increase our understanding of the diversity of dinosaur species from this time.\u201d\n\nThe four bones were found over several weeks last year by three different groups. This study confirmed that those separate bones were likely from the same dinosaur, which probably lived north of where its bones were found; the researchers speculate the carcass had washed out into the shallow sea nearby.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings will be published in the journal Papers in Palaeontology.\n\nPaul Farrell, from the Isle of Wight town of Ryde, was one of the people who stumbled upon the bones. \u201cI was walking along the beach, kicking stones and came across what looked like a bone from a dinosaur. I was really shocked to find out it could be a new species,\u201d he said in the release.\n\nThe other two people who found the bones were both fossil hunters. The Isle of Wight is one of the top locations for dinosaur remains and fossils in Europe, and is home to the Dinosaur Isle Museum, where all of the lucky fossil hunters brought the Vectaerovenator bones.\n\nThey will now be displayed at the museum.\n\n\u201cThis remarkable discovery of connected fossils by three different individuals and groups will add to the extensive collection we have and it\u2019s great we can now confirm their significance and put them on display for the public to marvel at,\u201d said Martin Munt, the museum curator."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.socialnews.xyz\/2020\/08\/13\/observatory-captures-peak-of-perseid-meteor-shower-video\/","domain":"socialnews.xyz","published_date":"2020-08-13 19:18:42","title":"Observatory captures peak of Perseid meteor shower (Video)","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.socialnews.xyz\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/02\/social-news-xyz-header.png","content":"Title\n\nObservatory captures peak of Perseid meteor shower (Video)\n\nDescription\n\nThe Canary Island Long-Baseline Observatory on Tenerife captured the peak of the Perseid meteor shower.

When water is put in the microwave, the container in which it (liquid) is kept itself heats up. In this process, water just does not get heated from the bottom but from all sides.

It\u2019s hard to believe, but it\u2019s now been eight years since NASA\u2019s incredibly capable Curiosity rover touched down on the Red Planet, and NASA is celebrating the incredible accomplishment while looking forward to the rover\u2019s still-bright future.\n\nThe rover landed on Mars on August 5th, 2012, and has been exploring the Martian landscape ever since. Its targeted landing zone, a massive impact site known as the Gale Crater, is an incredibly interesting place for study. It\u2019s home not only to areas that are thought to have once been rich with water but also features a massive mountain in its center. Among its many discoveries is the evidence that life could have existed on Mars long ago.\n\nNASA offers a brief summary of what Curiosity has been up to since it landed eight years ago:\n\nSince touchdown, the rover journeyed more than 14 miles (23 kilometers), drilling 26 rock samples and scooping six soil samples along the way as it revealed that ancient Mars was indeed suitable for life. Studying the textures and compositions of ancient rock strata is helping scientists piece together how the Martian climate changed over time, losing its lakes and streams until it became the cold desert it is today.\n\nSo, a couple of things to note here. For starters, traveling 14 miles over the course of 8 years might not sound like much of an accomplishment, but you have to consider that the rover is taking commands from Earth that take up to 20+ minutes to make the trip.\n\nFurthermore, the rover\u2019s handlers have to be extremely careful with the robot, as any serious damage or mishap with the pricey machine could lead to lengthy downtime or even the end of the mission as a whole. So, the rover creeps along at very slow speeds, and decisions on where it heads are made by a large group of talented scientists.\n\nThis is all in addition to the fact that when the rover reaches one of its several destinations, it conducts science experiments and observations that can take a long time to complete. These experiments, like drilling and analyzing rock samples, have to be done very carefully, and NASA has had to struggle with some downtime of its drilling instrument along the way as well.\n\nBut this is hardly the end of Curiosity\u2019s adventure. In fact, in some ways it\u2019s just getting started. The rover has a nuclear power source that should be capable of providing it with power for at least 14 years. Assuming the rover\u2019s body is up to the task, we can expect many more years of scientific discoveries from Curiosity, and many more anniversaries as well."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.livescience.com\/lunar-laser-bounce.html","domain":"livescience.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 12:02:00","title":"Astronomers bounced a laser off a spacecraft whirling around the moon","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net\/iBBrnS8gAomW4siPhw5rZF-320-80.gif","content":"image This photograph shows the laser-ranging facility at the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory in Greenbelt, Maryland trying to hit the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) with green laser light. For the first time, another facility in Grasse, France successfully bounced a laser (using infrared light) off the LRO's onboard mirror. Image caption\n\nFor the first time, scientists have successfully bounced a laser off a mirror that's attached to a spacecraft whirling around the moon .\n\nBouncing lasers off mirrors on the lunar surface is an old trick. Astronauts walking on the moon first left reflectors behind in 1969. And since then, researchers have bounced lasers off those reflectors to make precise measurements of the distance between the moon and Earth , using the speed of light and the time it takes for the laser beam to return to Earth.\n\nBut hitting a laser in orbit around the moon is a much trickier task. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) has orbited the moon with a mirror on its back since 2009. But nearly a decade went by without a single successful laser bounce. In an Aug. 6 paper in the journal Earth, Planets and Space , a team of researchers report the first successful laser contact: Twice on Sept. 4, 2018 and twice again between Aug. 23 and Aug. 24, 2019, technicians at the Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) station in Grasse, France, shot laser bursts at the LRO and saw the light return 2.5 seconds later.\n\nRelated: Why does the moon shine?\n\nTo make sure that the light bouncing off the LRO returns in the direction from which it came, the mirror on its back is more complicated than the one in your bathroom. Like the older mirrors on the lunar surface, it's a \"corner cube\" \u2014 a series of three-dimensional mirrors, each literally shaped like the inside of one corner of a cube. When a laser hits it, the light bounces three times before the geometry of the mirror returns it in the precise direction from which it came.\n\nAn animation illustrates how corner cube reflectors bounce light back in the direction from which it came. (Image credit: V.pantaloni\/Wikimedia Commons\/ CC BY 4.0)\n\nTracking the movement of the LRO over time is an interesting scientific project in its own right. But, the researchers wrote, these four successful laser contacts don't offer enough data to track that movement. The LRO is still moving too fast and too unpredictably to reliably hit with a laser, and all four contacts were made under what the researchers described as ideal conditions. The moon, LRO and France were all lined up perfectly to improve the odds of laser contact.\n\nApollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin holds two experiments that he and Neil Armstong left behind on the moon. In his right hand is a corner cube reflector, the first of five that NASA astronauts eventually deposited on the lunar surface. (Image credit: Neil Armstrong\/NASA)\n\nOver the long-term, studies of the LRO mirror could help resolve a tricky problem impacting the mirrors left on the lunar surface. All of those mirrors have become less reflective over time, and researchers aren't sure why. But that lost quality is making precise measurements more difficult. The issue could be that long-term exposure to solar radiation just weakens the mirrors. In that case, the LRO's mirror should weaken over time at the same rate. Alternatively, lunar dust or faint haze from the moon's thin atmosphere could be obscuring the mirrors, the researchers wrote. In that case, the LRO's reflectivity should remain more or less unchanged over time high in orbit, even as the surface mirrors degrade.\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now Get the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

We happen to live on it, and it\u2019s a major reason why we\u2019re here to begin with. However, over time we\u2019ve slowly learned that other icy bodies in our little stellar neighborhood also have lots and lots of liquid water, but it just happens to be hiding deep beneath thick sheets of ice.\n\nWe know that the moons Enceladus and Europa both have massive subsurface oceans that are heated by tidal forces and may even have the ingredients to support life. That\u2019s pretty exciting stuff, and now we can add another world to that same list: the dwarf planet Ceres.\n\nCeres is a large, icy world that resides in the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars. It\u2019s not quite big enough to be a planet, but that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have some interesting things to share with us. In a new series of studies published in Nature this week, researchers explain that they\u2019ve discovered evidence of a massive subsurface ocean of salty water resting beneath the dwarf planet\u2019s icy shell.\n\n\u201cThe surface and internal structure of Ceres show evidence of a global process of aqueous alteration, indicating the existence of an ocean in the past. However, it is not clear whether part of this ocean is still present and whether residual fluids are still circulating in the dwarf planet,\u201d the researchers write, describing that they found evidence of the recent deposition of minerals on the dwarf planet\u2019s surface.\n\n\u201cThe spatial distribution of the hydrated phase suggests that chloride salts are the solid residue of deep brines that reached the surface only recently, or are still ascending. These salts are very efficient in maintaining Ceres\u2019s warm internal temperature and lowering the eutectic temperature of the brines, in which case ascending salty fluids may exist in Ceres today.\u201d\n\nAs humans continue to explore the solar system and dream of finding evidence of past or present life, focusing on ocean worlds and exploring their potential to host life could be our best bet. The issue, of course, is that we\u2019ve never sent a mission to any of these worlds in search of life, and doing so would mean inventing new ways of detecting what\u2019s happening deep beneath the frosty surface. That could mean digging very, very deep and then exploring the oceans themselves, or analyzing the water that spews from cracks and fissures in their surface."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.highnorthnews.com\/en\/new-study-warns-abrupt-arctic-warming-canadian-ice-shelf-collapses","domain":"highnorthnews.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 06:19:01","title":"New Study Warns of Abrupt Arctic Warming as Canadian Ice Shelf Collapses","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.highnorthnews.com\/themes\/custom\/hnn_theme\/logo.png","content":"A new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change says that existing climate models underestimate how rapidly the Arctic is currently warming. The new research concludes that today\u2019s rate of temperature increase \u2013 about one degree Celsius per decade \u2013 is similar to the rate of warming that occurred during periods of abrupt warming during the last ice age when temperatures could increase as much as 10-15 degrees during a few decades.\n\nDuring the last \u201cice age\u201d which lasted from around 120,000 years ago until 12,000 years ago, more than twenty periods of rapid warming occurred. These periods were preceded by a rapid and abrupt increase of air temperature globally, but especially over the Arctic.\n\nThe researchers thus warn that the current warming trends in the region are akin to what occurred during the last ice age and that current climate models don\u2019t take into account the rapid warming of the past 40 years and discount the potential for abrupt warming.\n\n\u201cThis is a warning that we have entered what must be characterized as an abrupt change in the climate\u201d, says one of the\n\nstudy\u2019s authors, Eystein Jansen, professor at the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Change at the University of Bergen.\n\nLess ice leads to increased warming\n\nThe study also points to the fact that Arctic sea ice has disappeared much quicker than most models predicted, says co-author Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen, a professor at the University of Copenhagen's Niels Bohr Institute (NBI).\n\n\"Changes are occurring so rapidly during the summer months that sea ice is likely to disappear faster than most climate models have ever predicted. We must continue to closely monitor temperature changes and incorporate the right climate processes into these models.\u201d\n\nHe further adds that the new research \u201cdemonstrates that we have been clearly underestimating the rate of temperature increases in the atmosphere nearest to the sea level, which has ultimately caused sea ice to disappear faster than we had anticipated.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s largest ice shelf disintegrates\n\nThe impact of climate change on the Arctic region was on display earlier this month when Canada\u2019s largest intact ice shelf \u2013 large slabs of ice attached to the coastline and extending into the ocean \u2013 collapsed over the course of a few days.\n\nThe Milne Ice Shelf on Ellesmere Island, part of Canada\u2019s Nunavut territory, broke up and lost around 80 square kilometers \u2013 about 43 percent of its total surface area.

Now, chemists in Arts & Sciences have developed a method to make or modify \"smart bricks\" that can store energy until required for powering devices. A proof-of-concept published Aug. 11 in Nature Communications shows a brick directly powering a green LED light.\n\n\"Our method works with regular brick or recycled bricks, and we can make our own bricks as well,\" said Julio D'Arcy, assistant professor of chemistry. \"As a matter of fact, the work that we have published in Nature Communications stems from bricks that we bought at Home Depot right here in Brentwood (Missouri); each brick was 65 cents.\"\n\nWalls and buildings made of bricks already occupy large amounts of space, which could be better utilized if given an additional purpose for electrical storage. While some architects and designers have recognized the humble brick's ability to absorb and store the sun's heat, this is the first time anyone has tried using bricks as anything more than thermal mass for heating and cooling.\n\nD'Arcy and colleagues, including Washington University graduate student Hongmin Wang, first author of the new study, showed how to convert red bricks into a type of energy storage device called a supercapacitor.\n\n\"In this work, we have developed a coating of the conducting polymer PEDOT, which is comprised of nanofibers that penetrate the inner porous network of a brick; a polymer coating remains trapped in a brick and serves as an ion sponge that stores and conducts electricity,\" D'Arcy said.\n\nThe red pigment in bricks -- iron oxide, or rust -- is essential for triggering the polymerisation reaction. The authors' calculations suggest that walls made of these energy-storing bricks could store a substantial amount of energy.\n\n\"PEDOT-coated bricks are ideal building blocks that can provide power to emergency lighting,\" D'Arcy said. \"We envision that this could be a reality when you connect our bricks with solar cells -- this could take 50 bricks in close proximity to the load. These 50 bricks would enable powering emergency lighting for five hours.\n\n\"Advantageously, a brick wall serving as a supercapacitor can be recharged hundreds of thousands of times within an hour.

The scientists used special kits designed to measure the amounts of particular chemicals and compounds, such as electrolytes (a mixture of sodium and chloride) and proteins.\n\nSurprisingly, given that birds, reptiles and mammals have different structures for producing tears, all the species\u2019 tears\u2014including those of humans\u2014had a similar chemical makeup, with similar amounts of electrolytes, although bird and reptile tears had slightly higher concentrations.

Such proteins are important for maintaining the stability of the ocular surface.

They were experimenting with fire whirlwinds when they accidentally generated a whirling, blue, soot-free flame that consumes all the fuel it encounters.\n\nThis elusive type of flame has puzzled researchers ever since, until now, when its mystery may have finally been cracked.\n\n\u201cThe blue whirl is a small, stable, spinning blue flame that evolved spontaneously in recent laboratory experiments while studying turbulent, sooty fire whirls. It burns a range of different liquid hydrocarbon fuels cleanly with no soot production, presenting a previously unknown potential way for low-emission combustion,\u201d the researchers describe the phenomenon in a new study.\n\nAlthough fire whirls are dangerous, violent, and turbulent, they can be created in (relatively) safe conditions for laboratory study. What\u2019s more, because the whirl burns without soot in a seemingly clean combustion, it might indeed be used for ocean clean-ups.\n\nBut even with lab experiments, researchers still couldn\u2019t tell exactly what was going on with the flame.\n\nFlames generally fall into two categories: premixed and diffusion flames. Premixed flames occur in homogeneous mixtures where the fuel and the oxidant are already mixed prior to the reaction (think of a Bunsen burner); premixed flames can in turn be rich or lean, depending on whether they have an excess or dearth of fuel relative to the oxidizer. Meanwhile, in diffusion flames, the fuel and the oxidant are initially separate, which limits how fast the fire can burn. The blue whirl seems to be neither, or rather, a bit of both.\n\nImage credits: Chung et al (2020) \/ Science Advances.\n\nTo crack the mystery, Joseph Chung and Xiao Zhang at the University of Maryland, College Park, and their colleagues created computer simulations of the flame.\n\nThey tweaked the model parameters more and more, until it finally started behaving like what they observed in experiments, and that\u2019s when they finally understood what was going on.\n\nAccording to these simulations, the blue whirl consists of three different flames: a diffusion flame, a premixed rich, and a premixed lean flame. When they all meet together, they form a fourth structure \u2014 a triple flame forming a blue ring.\n\n\u201cThe results also show that the flow structure emerges as the result of vortex breakdown, a fluid instability that occurs in swirling flows. These simulations are a critical step forward in understanding how to use this previously unknown form of clean combustion,\u201d the researchers explain.\n\nImage credits: Chung et al (2020) \/ Science Advances.\n\nAside from helping explain an interesting phenomenon, the study could also help researchers learn to harness the power of the blue whirl for a cleaner, more efficient combustion, for instance reducing emissions from burning hydrocarbons in power plants or stoves.\n\nWhile burning hydrocarbons is far from ideal and we will hopefully transition to renewable energy as quickly as possible, it won\u2019t happen overnight and any tool that could help us is more than welcome.\n\nJournal Reference"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.technologynetworks.com\/immunology\/news\/staphylococcus-reveals-a-weakness-338148","domain":"technologynetworks.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 07:55:57","title":"Staphylococcus Reveals a Weakness","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/assets.technologynetworks.com\/production\/dynamic\/images\/content\/default\/default-960x540.jpg?cb=10829274","content":"Read time: 2 minutes\n\n\u201cStaphylococcus aureus\u201d \u2013 also known as \u201cgolden staph\u201d \u2013 has the ability to develop in highly variable environmental conditions (on the skin, in the nose, on sterile surfaces, and so forth). Its great adaptability depends especially on a protein (an RNA helicase) involved in the degradation of RNA messengers that have become useless. In their attempts to have a better understanding of how this helicase works, scientists from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) discovered that it contributes to another physiological process, without any apparent link to the first: the synthesis of the fatty acids that are the essential constituents of the bacterial membrane. This advance, to be published in the journal PLoS Genetics, offers an interesting insight since fatty acid synthesis is precisely one of the targets favoured by numerous laboratories to fight this pathogen that is difficult to treat due to its resistance to antibiotics.\n\n\n\nGolden staph (staphylococcus aureus) is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium that is capable of adapting to highly variable environments. It can be found in the nostrils of 25 to 30% of the population, although this is generally not a problem. However, the bacterium can take advantage of a drop in immunity or a surgical operation to trigger a real infection. And the problem with golden staph is its ability to develop resistance to antibiotic drugs, which often makes it difficult \u2013 sometimes impossible \u2013 to treat.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy laboratory studies a protein, RNA helicase, which plays an important role in golden staph\u2019s ability to adapt to very different environments,\u201d begins Patrick Linder, a professor in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine in UNIGE\u2019s Faculty of Medicine. \u201cWhen the environment changes, the bacterium has to be able to synthesise new proteins that are more suitable and stop the production of others that are no longer useful. The helicase we\u2019re interested in \u2013 called CshA \u2013 is involved in the degradation of the RNA, those molecules derived from the DNA and used in protein synthesis.\u201d\n\n\n\nCold-sensitive bacteria\n\n\n\nOddly enough, when the helicase is absent (due, for example, to a genetic mutation), the researchers found that the cultured bacteria could no longer form colonies if the temperature dropped below a certain threshold (around 25\u00b0C).\n\n\n\nThe Geneva-based biologists undertook a series of experiments designed to improve our understanding of the link between golden staph\u2019s sensitivity to cold, the degradation of the RNA and the adaptation capacity. They discovered that the same helicase is probably also required in another physiological process, namely the synthesis of fatty acids, which are the constituents of bacterial membranes.\n\n\u201cUsing cultured golden staph stripped of helicases, we succeeded in isolating 82 gene mutations (appearing spontaneously in many different bacteria), which meant that their holders regained the ability to form colonies at 25\u00b0C,\u201d continues Vanessa Khemici, a researcher in Patrick Linder\u2019s laboratory and the article\u2019s first author. \u201cWe identified almost all the affected genes, and no less than two thirds of them are involved in the fatty acid synthesis.\u201d\n\nThe findings also helped the researchers understand that the lack of the helicase has the effect of deregulating the fatty acid synthesis and decreasing the flexibility of the membrane when the temperature drops. This prevents the membrane from fulfilling its functions properly and the bacterium from growing. In a second step, each of the 82 mutations succeeded in its own way in restoring the initial balance by acting on the different genetic levers involved in fatty acid synthesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nScientific controversy\n\n\n\n\u201cA section of the scientific community supports the idea that a future treatment against staphylococcus will involve a drug capable of inhibiting fatty acid synthesis,\u201d notes Professor Linder, \u201cbut there is a controversy about it because some studies contradict this point of view.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe results of the Geneva scientists do not provide a clear-cut answer or make it possible to directly develop a drug against these bacteria. Nevertheless, they fit into this context and provide a better understanding of golden staph\u2019s fundamental mechanisms. The discovery of this unprecedented link between the fluidity of the membrane and adaptation to environmental change represents an important step in the fight against the bacterium. It is undoubtedly for these reasons that the journal decided to publish an overview in parallel with the article.\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n\nVanessa Khemici,Julien Prados,Bianca Petrignani,Benjamin Di Nolfi,Elodie Berg\u00e9,Caroline Manzano,Caroline Giraud,Patrick Linder.

As seasonal ice vaporised in the spring, these 1,640-foot-tall (500-meter-tall) cliffs at Mars\u2019 north pole began to crumble\n\nAs HiRISE pans over large swaths of Mars\u2019 surface, it occasionally discovers surprises like this towering dust devil, which was captured from 185 miles (297 kilometers) above the ground\n\nAmong its instruments, MRO carries three cameras: A fisheye lens, one for 19-mile-wide black and white terrain shots and the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) which provides the most striking photos.\n\nAble to zoom in on surface features at the highest resolution, the detailed, colour images from HiRISE have captured dramatic scenes of nature on the Red Planet that have captivated audiences back on Earth.\n\nThese scenes include tumbling avalanches, sky scraping dust devils, and other features of a changing landscape that show Mars is more than just a red rock.\n\nThe camera has also provided images of other NASA spacecraft at Mars, like the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers, the Martian moon Phobos and even a picture of Earth.\n\nAs of early August 2020, the HiRISE camera alone had taken 6,882,204 images, generating 194 terabytes of data sent from Mars since 2006.\n\nThis \u2018false colour\u2019 image shows sand ripples from February 2009. The \u2018false colour\u2019 has been added to this image to accentuate certain details, like the tops of dunes and ripples. Many of these landforms are migrating, as they do on Earth\n\nA dramatic, fresh impact crater dominates this image taken by HiRISE. The crater spans approximately 100 feet (30 meters) in diameter and is surrounded by a large, rayed blast zone\n\nThe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is managed by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Southern California and the team that run the spacecraft selected a number of images they deem \u2018among the most striking\u2019 of the planet.\n\nOne of those images shared by the JPL team shows a red dusty avalanche plunging down a 1,640 foot tall cliff in May 2019 \u2013 caused by seasonal ice vaporising in the Spring.\n\nEvery Spring the Sun shines on the sides of the stack of layers at the North Pole of the Red Planet and the warmth destabilised the ice \u2013 with blocks of it and dust breaking loose.\n\nAs this happened the cliffs at Mars\u2019 north pole began to crumble and this exposed the many layers of ice and dust that have settled along its face during the different Martian eras.\n\nLike the rings of a tree, each layer has a story to tell scientists about how the environment was changing.\n\nWhen the rocks reach the bottom of the cliff face, the blocks kick up a cloud of dust that appears as an avalanche in the photos shared by the NASA JPL team.\n\nDust was a major factor in a few of the images shared by the team as dust storms are routine on Mars.\n\nMost are limited to small regions and are not as dramatic as what\u2019s portrayed in movies but once or twice a decade a series of regional storms create \u2018domino effect\u2019 that result in the dust covering the whole planet.\n\nThe MRO captured one of these events in 2018 and it darkened the region above the Opportunity rover, depriving its solar panels of sunlight and ultimately leading to the end of the mission.\n\nNASA rovers are featured in some of the other images shared from the MRO by the JPL team \u2013 they show the final traverse map of Opportunity and the tracks made by Curiosity in the Martian soil.\n\nThe pictures shared in the NASA photo essay show a changing and active landscape including seasonal dark marks on the Martian equatorial slope and ripples in sand dunes on the surface of the Red Planet.\n\nLand changes over time, so having a spacecraft at Mars for more than 15 years offers a unique perspective, according to Leslie Tamppari, deputy project scientist at JPL, who said \u2018the more we look, the more we discover\u2019.\n\n\u2018Before MRO, it wasn\u2019t clear what on Mars really changed, if anything. We thought the atmosphere was so thin that there was almost no sand motion and most dune movement happened in the ancient past.\u2019\n\nThis composite image shows how the appearance of dark markings on Martian slope changes with the seasons. These dark streaks appear in the same places at around the same times of year\n\nThis is the final traverse map for Opportunity, showing where the rover was on June 10, 2018, the last date it made contact with its team before it was lost in a dust storm\n\nOther images include a dramatic impact crater spanning 100ft across from a large meteorite than wouldn\u2019t have been able to penetrate Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nMars has a thin atmosphere \u2013 just 1 per cent as dense as Earth\u2019s. As a result, there\u2019s less of a protective barrier to burn up space debris. That means larger meteors make it through the Red Planet\u2019s atmosphere than Earth\u2019s.\n\nNASA also shared an image showing dark marks on an equatorial Martian slope that appear in the same place and at around the same times every year.\n\nIt takes sharp eyes to find unique features on Mars, like recurring slope lineae. It was initially proposed they were caused by brine, since salt could allow water to remain liquid in the thin Martian atmosphere.\n\nThe consensus now, however, is that they\u2019re actually caused by dark sand sliding down inclines.\n\nThe streaks were discovered by Lujendra Ojha, who was an undergraduate at the University of Arizona, which operates the HiRISE camera, and now is a professor at Rutgers University.\n\n\u2018Sometimes you\u2019re just looking at the right place at the right time,\u2019 Ojha said. \u2018I was completely baffled when I first spotted this, because I was just a student at the time \u2013 I wasn\u2019t even in a planetary program.\u2019\n\nOn the left is a picture of Mars taken by MRO showing the planet before the 2018 dust storm enveloped the whole planet \u2013 as seen by the nearly featureless world shown in the right hand image\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the planet itself that MRO focused on, during its mission it turned its sights back to Earth to get a view of our world and captured a detailed image of the Martian moon Phobos.\n\nNamed for the Greek god of fear, Phobos is one of Mars\u2019 two moons \u2013 the other is called Deimos, named for the god of terror.\n\nPhobos is only about 13 miles (21 kilometers) across but despite its small size, Phobos is of great interest to scientists as nobody is sure how it came to be within the orbit of Mars.\n\nA Japanese mission is scheduled to launch to Phobos in the near future, and the moon has been proposed as a staging ground for astronauts before they go to Mars.\n\nThe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter left Earth for the Red Planet on August 12, 2005 and cost $720 million \u2013 its purpose is the study the geology and climate of the planet and provide reconnaissance for future landing sites.\n\nIn 2021 the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and the NASA Ingenuity helicopter will land in the Jezero Crater to search for signs of ancient Martian life.\n\nThe rover is equipped with a number of cameras and will be able to send back new pictures of the surface of the Red Planet to show one of our nearest stellar neighbours in greater detail than has been seen so far.\n\nHiRISE took two images of the larger of Mars\u2019 two moons, on March 23, 2008.

Sunspots appear as darker, cooler patches on the sun\u2019s surface that may last from a few days to a few months. They were noticed by ancient Chinese and Greek astronomers and came to prominence following telescopic observations by Galileo and others. The number of spots on the sun at any time follows the 11-year cycle and the sun is slightly brighter during maximum activity.\n\nIn the early 20th century it was realised that sunspots are associated with strong magnetic fields. Sunspots and other solar activity such as flares are the result of interaction of the sun\u2019s rotating gas with the global magnetic field that is generated in the sun\u2019s interior through what is known as the solar dynamo.\n\nView image in fullscreen Though Nigel Weiss left South Africa as a schoolboy and made his career in Britain, he kept up strong ties with his native country\n\nNigel\u2019s contribution lay in studying the detailed interaction between the rotation and magnetic field of the sun, and its convective motions.\n\nIn 1966 he was the first to calculate the mechanism of \u201cflux expulsion\u201d by rotating eddies, by which a conducting fluid undergoing rotation acts to expel the magnetic field from the region of motion, a process now known to occur in the photosphere \u2013 the visible surface \u2013 of the sun and other stars. He also demonstrated how the magnetic field in the sun\u2019s convective zone can be concentrated into \u201cropes\u201d from which fluid motion is excluded, a process important for sunspots and solar flares.\n\nAs part of his wide-ranging studies of how the sun\u2019s convective motions interact with the magnetic field, he showed how the oscillation in the magnetic field responsible for the solar activity cycle can become chaotic. Nigel\u2019s view, in contradiction to that of some other experts, was that this means it is not possible to predict reliably the nature of the next solar cycle.\n\nBorn in Johannesburg, Nigel was the son of Oscar Weiss and his wife, Molly (nee Kisch). Oscar, a geophysicist, travelled extensively before settling in South Africa. Many members of his large Jewish-Hungarian family were killed at Auschwitz. Molly was one of the few female opposition MPs in South Africa in the 1960s.\n\nFrom Hilton college, Natal, Nigel went to Britain to study for two years at Rugby school, and then natural sciences at Clare College, Cambridge. From researching seismic tremors he switched to the study of magnetohydrodynamics, the behaviour of electrically conducting fluid in the presence of electric and magnetic fields, completing his PhD in 1961.\n\nView image in fullscreen Sunspots \u2013 darker, cooler patches on the sun\u2019s surface \u2013 in 2001. Photograph: Reuters\n\nDuring a spell at Culham Laboratory (now Culham Science Centre), in Oxfordshire, he pioneered the use of stable numerical codes for solving magnetohydrodynamic problems, and used these for his much celebrated flux expulsion work.\n\nIn 1965 he moved back to Cambridge as a lecturer in the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics, and a fellow of Clare College. There he remained throughout his academic life, becoming professor of mathematical astrophysics in 1987, and emeritus professor in 2001. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1992.

He was something of a polymath, able to discuss anything from 16th-century history to 20th-century opera and able to get to grips with unfamiliar languages in order to communicate in far-flung countries. He explored occupied Vienna by himself aged 15 and two years later worked for the Hudson Bay Company in northern Canada.\n\nIn his 60s and 70s he went several times to India, to work and travel extensively. From an early age he had a keen interest in 20th-century art and encouraged his father to build up a collection; in later life he was a member of the National Gallery scientific consultative group (1996-2012).\n\nView image in fullscreen Nigel Weiss, right, receiving the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society from Michael Rowan-Robinson in 2007\n\nNigel deplored apartheid, but wanted to keep up his close ties with South Africa. He and Judy set up an educational trust in Cape Town to provide school and university bursaries each year for young South Africans from townships to access more education, and kept in touch with them as they progressed.\n\nHis university webpage carries a striking statement on solar activity and global warming. A grand maximum of solar magnetic activity lasting about 80 years has come to an end. The sun might be entering a grand minimum, which would be expected to have a mild cooling effect on the Earth\u2019s climate.\n\nBut he had always maintained that \u201cany temperature changes caused by variations in solar activity are small compared to the global warming that we are already experiencing, and very small compared to what will happen if we continue to burn fossil fuel at the present rate\u201d.\n\nHe is survived by Judy, their children and five grandchildren."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.sproutwired.com\/to-start-with-at-any-time-house-helicopter-is-en-route-to-mars-aboard-nasas-rover\/","domain":"sproutwired.com","published_date":"2020-08-06 22:58:55","title":"To start with-at any time house helicopter is en route to Mars aboard NASA's rover","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.sproutwired.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/To-start-with-at-any-time-house-helicopter-is-en-route-760x456.jpeg","content":"NASA\u2019s new Mars rover, which released on July 30, has a miniature helicopter tucked inside of its stomach.\n\nPerseverance will be NASA\u2019s fifth rover to Mars, but its helicopter stowaway, named Ingenuity, will be the initial spacecraft of its kind. About two months immediately after the rover lands, it is programmed to lower the helicopter to the Martian floor, again absent, and observe as the tiny drone carries out a collection of examination flights.\n\nIf effective, these will be the initial managed flights ever performed on a further planet.\n\nIngenuity is just a technological demonstration, but it could kick off a new method to checking out other planets.\n\n\u201cIn the potential, it could renovate how we do planetary science on these other worlds, and at some point be a scout so that we can determine out where accurately do we require to send out our robots,\u201d NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine claimed in a press briefing before the launch.\n\nThis is how the Ingenuity helicopter is effective.\n\nThe 1st drone footage from Mars\n\n\n\nAn artist\u2019s strategy of the Ingenuity helicopter on the Martian surface area.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA\/JPL-Caltech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven for a 4-pound machine like Ingenuity, the thin Martian environment makes flying tough. The air has just 1% of the density of Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\n\u201cThe first and foremost challenge is to make a auto that\u2019s gentle sufficient to be lifted,\u201d MiMi Aung, who leads the helicopter project at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, described in a online video about the spacecraft. \u201cThe next is to deliver elevate.\u201d\n\nTo capture sufficient air, the helicopter\u2019s four carbon-fiber blades have to spin in reverse directions at about 2,400 revolutions for each moment \u2014 about eight times as rapid as a passenger helicopter on Earth. To electrical power all that spinning, solar panels on top rated of the spacecraft will soak up the sun\u2019s power.\n\n\n\nAn animated rendering of Ingenuity, a helicopter saved in the tummy of NASA\u2019s most current Mars rover.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA\/JPL-Caltech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is a equilibrium of a pretty gentle system, nonetheless having more than enough electrical power that is essential to spin the rotors so rapid to lift, and on top of it having to style and design in the autonomy,\u201d Aung said.\n\nDue to the fact communicating with spacecraft on Mars takes a couple of minutes, ground controllers on Earth cannot immediate Ingenuity\u2019s flight in serious time. So engineers have previously developed and programmed 5 flights for the helicopter to have out autonomously in spring 2021.\n\nThe very first flight will just examination that the helicopter can get off the ground and hover 3 meters (10 feet) in the air. From there, each test will be additional tricky than the previous, culminating in a final flight that could have the helicopter around 50 meters (160 toes) of Martian ground.\n\n\n\nAn animation of NASA\u2019s Ingenuity helicopter checking out the Martian area.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA\/JPL-Caltech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo cameras on the underside of the drone will capture footage of the Martian surface under \u2014 a person in colour, and 1 in black and white.\n\nPerseverance will search on with its have cameras, enabling the helicopter and the rover to report every single other.\n\n\u201cVisualize on the lookout from Perseverance out at a helicopter that is traveling all over Perseverance, and the helicopter is searching again at Perseverance acquiring us pictures of what Perseverance is executing,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cWe\u2019re heading to be capable to see with our personal eyes, with movement pictures, these type of things to do taking place on a further globe. And I just won\u2019t be able to inform you how enthusiastic I am.\u201d\n\nNASA now has plans to mail at the very least a person helicopter to a different environment past Mars: A mission prepared for 2026 would send a nuclear-driven rotocraft to search for alien existence on Saturn\u2019s largest moon, Titan.\n\n\u201cWhat is truly most essential is almost everything we\u2019re finding out here is for the upcoming rotocraft units that we want to introduce into space exploration,\u201d Aung reported.\n\nObtaining the helicopter to Mars necessitates a \u2018magic trick\u2019\n\nNASA\u2019s Affiliate Administrator, Thomas Zurbuchen, proposed the helicopter late in the rover\u2019s structure. But the group guiding the equipment was psyched about the idea.\n\n\u201cI informed Thomas, regardless of what you can do to make that take place, I am all for it,\u201d Bridenstine reported.\n\n\n\nAn engineer observes a check of the Mars Helicopter Delivery Program at Lockheed Martin Space in Denver, Colorado, on April 2019.\n\n\n\nLMS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy that time, the top of Perseverance was currently complete of devices and devices. There was very tiny home to squeeze in a full new equipment.\n\n\u201cForm of late in the activity, we ended up asked to accommodate this little thing called the Mars helicopter,\u201d Matt Wallace, the Perseverance deputy challenge manager at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained in the briefing. \u201cWe experienced to do a small little bit of a magic trick to get that 1 on the rover. We pulled a bit of a rabbit out of the hat.\u201d\n\nConsidering that the underside of the rover experienced a extend of free of charge panel, engineers tucked the mild, compact helicopter inside.\n\nLockheed Martin, 1 of NASA\u2019s contractors, designed the procedure that will decreased Ingenuity to the Martian floor. Around two months immediately after it lands, Perseverance will fall the shield that covers the helicopter. The rover will then generate to whichever flat, particles-free of charge area the missions managers have picked for traveling Ingenuity.\n\nFollowing six days of checking out all the robot\u2019s methods, mission professionals will ship the sign to release the helicopter. A little electric motor, a spring-loaded arm, and a pyrotechnic system will slowly and gradually twist Ingenuity absent from the rover into an upright posture, then drop the drone 5 inches to the floor.\n\nThe 19-inch-tall helicopter will have about 26 inches of clearance underneath the rover\u2019s tummy.\n\nFor now, this complex shipping program lies in wait as it travels 314 million miles

transform from solitary to \"gregarious\"?\n\nA study published Wednesday in the journal Nature reveals the secret lies in a pheromone.\n\nAlmost like an irresistible perfume, the chemical compound is emitted by locusts when they find themselves in proximity to just a few others of their kind.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe chemical attracts other locusts, who join the group and also begin emitting the scent, creating a feedback loop that results in enormous swarms.\n\nThe discovery offers several tantalising possibilities, including genetically engineering locusts without the receptors that detect the swarming pheromone, or weaponising the pheromone to attract and trap the insects.\n\nThe study comes as record numbers of locusts devour crops in east Africa and threaten the food supply in Pakistan.\n\nIt focused on the migratory locust, the most widely distributed species of the insect, and examined several compounds produced by the bug.\n\nIt found that one in particular -- 4-vinylanisole, or 4VA -- appeared to attract locusts when emitted, and that the more locusts flocked together, the more 4VA they emitted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe team, led by Le Kang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, found solitary locusts began releasing 4VA when just four were placed together in a cage.\n\nThe team then examined how the locusts picked up the scent, and isolated the part of the locust antennae responsible for detecting the swarming pheromone.\n\nAnd from there, they found the gene necessary for the detection process and produced genetically modified locusts lacking the key Or35 gene.\n\nThe \"mutant locusts lost their attraction to 4VA compared with the wild-type locusts\", the study said.\n\nChemical interference\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe discoveries open up several possibilities for tackling the voracious pests, including using genetic modification, or tracking 4VA production to predict where swarms may be forming.\n\nThere are other avenues too, including weaponising the chemical, by using a synthetic form of it to bait traps to catch locusts.\n\nKang and his team tried this, setting up traps in both controlled settings and in the field, and in both cases found the locusts were effectively lured.\n\n\"Optimisation and adjustment are necessarily required from the experiments to practical application,\" Kang told AFP.\n\nBut he said the traps were \"significantly efficient\" and could be a comparatively easy first application of the research.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeslie Vosshall, head of Rockefeller University's Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Behavior, said perhaps the most exciting application would be finding a chemical that would block reception of 4VA.\n\n\"The discovery of such a molecule might provide a chemical antidote to insect aggregation and cause locusts to 'stand down' and return to their peaceful, solitary way of life,\" she wrote in a review commissioned by Nature.\n\nVosshall pointed out that there are still several unknowns, including whether 4VA is the only thing that causes swarm formation, and whether other locust species respond similarly to the compound.\n\nKang said genetic modification of locusts might offer \"sustainable and green control\" but acknowledged such a project would require large-scale and long-term efforts.\n\n\"This is an approach for long-term control of locusts, and needs strict biological security evaluation before application.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.ndtv.com\/world-news\/glaciers-could-have-sculpted-mars-valleys-study-2273648","domain":"ndtv.com","published_date":"2020-08-03

question of whether ancient life could have existed on Mars centres on the water that once flowed there, but new research published Monday suggests that many of the Red Planet's valleys were gouged by icy glaciers not rivers.\n\nThe study in Nature Geoscience, which comes amid a flurry of new Mars missions trying to discover if the now-barren planet ever hosted life, casts doubt on a dominant theory that the planet once had a warm, wet climate with abundant liquid water that sculpted the landscape.\n\nResearchers from Canada and the United States examined more than 10,000 Martian valleys and compared them to channels on Earth that were carved under glaciers.\n\n\"For the last 40 years, since Mars's valleys were first discovered, the assumption was that rivers once flowed on Mars, eroding and originating all of these valleys,\" said lead author Anna Grau Galofre in a statement released by the University of British Columbia.\n\nBut these formations come in a huge variety \"suggesting that many processes were at play to carve them,\" she added.\n\nResearchers found similarities between some Martian valleys and the subglacial channels of Devon Island, in the Canadian Arctic, which has been nicknamed \"Mars on Earth\" for its barren, freezing conditions and hosted NASA space training missions.\n\nThe study authors said their findings suggest that some Martian valleys could have been formed some 3.8 billion years ago by meltwater beneath ice sheets, which they said would align with climate modelling predicting that the planet would have been much cooler in its ancient past.\n\n\"The findings demonstrate that only a fraction of valley networks match patterns typical of surface water erosion, which is in marked contrast to the conventional view,\" said co-author Mark Jellinek.\n\nNature Geoscience noted that understanding climate conditions \"in the first billion years of Mars' history is important in determining whether the planet was ever habitable\".\n\nThe study authors said that icy temperatures could in fact have better supported ancient life.\n\n\"A sheet of ice would lend more protection and stability of underlying water, as well as providing shelter from solar radiation in the absence of a magnetic field - something Mars once had, but which disappeared billions of years ago,\" the University of British Columbia statement said.\n\nThe research comes after NASA launched its latest Mars rover, Perseverance, to look for signs of ancient microbial life on the Red Planet.\n\nIf all goes to plan, Perseverance will reach Mars on February 18, 2021 and collect rock samples that could provide invaluable clues about whether there was ever past life on Mars.\n\nHowever, the retrieval and analysis is not expected before the 2030s.\n\nChina has also launched its first Mars rover, which should arrive by May

why you see faces everywhere you look\n\nIn the 1970s, a NASA image of Mars seemed to show a human-like face \u2013 prompting observers to wonder if a lost civilisation once flourished on the Red Planet.\n\nBut the \u2018face on Mars\u2019 wasn\u2019t evidence of any Martian civilisation, it just showed the human tendency to see human faces in everything from plants to rocks to houses.\n\nA new study by researchers from UNSW Sydney has shed light on why exactly humans are wired to see faces everywhere we look.\n\nIn a paper published in the journal Psychological Science, lead researcher Dr Colin Palmer said that \u2018face pareidolia\u2019 \u2013 the phenomenon of seeing faces in everyday objects \u2013 is related to how we see and understand real human faces.\n\nRead more: UFO hunters claim NASA spotted a \u201crobot leg\u201d on Mars\n\nPalmer said: \u201cPages on websites like Flickr and Reddit have accumulated thousands of photographs of everyday objects that resemble faces, contributed by users from across the world.\n\n\u201cA striking feature of these objects is that they not only look like faces but can even convey a sense of personality or social meaning.\n\n\u201cFor example, the windows of a house might feel like two eyes watching you, and a capsicum might have a happy look on its face.\n\nThis wall in an old town in Tuscany, Italy, illustrates the phenomenon of pareidolia, of seeing faces in things. (Getty)\n\n\u201cThis basic pattern of features that defines the human face is something that our brain is particularly attuned to, and is likely to be what draws our attention to pareidolia objects.\n\n\u201cBut face perception isn\u2019t just about noticing the presence of a face. We also need to recognise who that person is, and read information from their face, like whether they are paying attention to us, and whether they are happy or upset.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that pareidolia seemed to activate the same mechanisms in the brains that extract important social information when one person looks at another.\n\nRead more: Just how worried should we be about the effect of blue light on skin?\n\nThey tested this using the process known as \u2018sensory adaptation\u2019, a kind of visual illusion where one\u2019s perception is affected by what has recently been seen.\n\n\u201cIf you are repeatedly shown pictures of faces that are looking towards your left, for example, your perception will actually change over time so that the faces will appear to be looking more rightwards than they really are,\u201d Palmer said.\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that this reflects a kind of habituation process in the brain, where cells involved in detecting gaze direction change their sensitivity when we are repeatedly exposed to faces with a particular direction of gaze.\u201d\n\nThe same process occurs with pareidolia faces, the researchers found.\n\nWe are wired to see fake faces everywhere, researchers said. (Getty)\n\n\u201cWe found that repeated exposure to pareidolia faces that conveyed a specific direction of attention (for example, objects that appeared to be \u2018looking towards the left\u2019) caused a change in the perception of where human faces are looking,\u201d Palmer said.\n\n\u201cThis is evidence of overlap in the neural mechanisms that are active when we experience face pareidolia and when we look at human faces.\u201d\n\nWhat this means, the researchers said, is if you feel like a pareidolia object is looking at you, or conveys some sort of emotion, \u201cit may be because the features of the object are activating mechanisms in your brain that are designed to read that kind of information from human faces\u201d.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus shows us how the planet\u2019s health is linked to our own\n\n\u201cSo we think face pareidolia is a kind of visual illusion. We know that the object doesn\u2019t really have a mind, but we can\u2019t help but see it as having mental characteristics like a \u2018direction of gaze\u2019 because of mechanisms in our visual system that become active when they detect an object with basic face-like features.\u201d\n\nPalmer believes face pareidolia is a product of our evolution, noting that studies have observed the phenomenon among monkeys, suggesting the brain function has been inherited from primates.\n\n\u201cOur brain has evolved to facilitate social interaction, and this shapes the way that we see the world around us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is an evolutionary advantage to being really good or really efficient at detecting faces, it's important to us socially. It's also important in detecting predators.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019ve evolved to be very good at detecting faces, this might then lead to false positives, where you sometimes see faces that aren't really there.\n\n\u201cAnother way of putting this is that it\u2019s better to have a system that's overly sensitive to detecting faces, than one that is not sensitive enough.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest videos from Yahoo UK Recommended"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/environment\/greenlands-ice-sheet-melts-beyond-point-of-return-study-5710961.html","domain":"moneycontrol.com","published_date":"2020-08-16 03:40:00","title":"Greenland's ice sheet melts beyond point of return: Study","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.moneycontrol.com\/images\/common\/header\/search_cash_reward_0809_400x33.png?impolicy=mchigh","content":"Greenland's vast ice sheet may have melted beyond the point of return, a new research suggests.

These birds are therefore probably the canaries in the coal mine\u2013we need to watch these sites carefully as climate change will affect this region.\u201d\n\nFretwell said one of the colonies was 180 kilometers (112 miles) from the Antarctic continent: \u201cMany of the penguin scientists we have talked to were disbelieving, as normally you expect them to be at the coast.\u201d Emperor penguins need stable sea ice, usually attached to land, for nine months of the year to breed successfully.\n\nThere were only 30 colonies known a decade ago, as they are usually in remote and inaccessible locations, where temperatures can fall as low as -50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit) in winter. But then Landsat satellite images began to be used. These have a resolution of 30 meters, which is enough to spot the larger colonies.\n\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel-2 satellite was launched in June 2015 and has a resolution of 10 meters. This enabled a search for the smaller penguin colonies, as reported by the BAS scientists in the journal Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation.\n\nEmperor penguins were expected to be present at fairly regular intervals around the coast of Antarctica, so the search was targeted in areas where none were known. \u201cIn every gap where we thought there might be a colony, we found one,\u201d said Fretwell.\n\nThree of the 11 colonies found had been suspected following ship or airplane sightings of penguins in the 1960s and 1980s, but Sentinel-2 images confirmed their presence. There are now 61 known emperor colonies around Antarctica. \u201cThere may be one or two very small colonies yet to be discovered, but I think we have filled in all the gaps now,\u201d said Fretwell.\n\nThe next step is to direct satellites with very high, 30-centimeter-resolution cameras over the colonies to enable the penguins to be counted. \u201cIt is dark at the moment in Antarctica, so we can\u2019t count them yet,\u201d said Fretwell. \u201cThe sun will come up either later this month or next month in most of these locations, and then we will start.\u201d\n\nPrevious studies have estimated that 90 percent of known colonies will be lost by the end of the century if no further action is taken to cut the greenhouse gas emissions that drive global heating. Even in the best-case scenario, where deep and fast cuts to carbon emissions limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 Celsius (34.7 Fahrenheit), the population of emperor penguins is projected to fall by 30 percent.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.sciencecodex.com\/new-study-quiet-sun-much-more-active-we-thought-653312","domain":"sciencecodex.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 04:00:00","title":"New study: The quiet Sun is much more active than we thought","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/earimediaprodweb.azurewebsites.net\/Api\/v1\/Multimedia\/47caa81b-e32c-4972-b4d0-85a21c858375\/Rendition\/low-res\/Content\/Public","content":"Solar activity varies in 11-year cycles. As the activity cycle switches to a new one, the Sun is usually very calm for several years.\n\nFor a long time, researchers have believed that there is not much of interest going on in the Sun during the passive period, therefore not worth studying. Now this assumption is showed to be false by Juha Kallunki, Merja Tornikoski and Irene Bj\u00f6rklund, researchers at Mets\u00e4hovi Radio Observatory, in their peer-reviewed research article published in Solar Physics. This is the first time that astronomers are systematically studying the phenomena of the solar minimum.\n\nNot all phenomena could be explained - yet\n\nThe researchers reached their conclusion by examining the solar radio maps detected by the Mets\u00e4hovi Radio Observatory and comparing them with the data collected by a satellite observing the Sun in the ultraviolet range. The solar maps showed active areas, or radio brightenings, which can be observed on the maps as hotter areas than the rest of the solar surface. According to researchers, there are three explanations for radio brightenings.\n\nFirst, some brightenings were observed in the polar areas on the solar maps that could be identified as coronal holes. Particle flows, or solar winds, ejected by coronal holes can cause auroras when they reach the Earth's atmosphere. The corona is the outer atmosphere of the Sun.\n\nSecond, the researchers observed brightenings from which, based on other observations, ejections of hot material from the surface of the sun could be detected.\n\nThird, radio brightenings were found in areas where, based on satellite observations, strong magnetic fields were detected.\n\nResearchers also found radio brightenings in some areas where no explanatory factor was found on the basis of satellite observations.\n\n'The other sources used did not explain the cause of the brightening. We don't know what causes those phenomena. We must continue our research', Kallunki says.\n\nAdditional observations and research are also needed to predict whether the phenomena of the solar minimum indicate something about the next active period, about its onset and intensity, for example. Each one of the last four cycles has been weaker than the previous one. Researchers do not know why the activity curves do not rise as high as during the previous cycles.\n\n'Solar activity cycles do not always last exactly 11 years, either', explains Docent Merja Tornikoski.\n\n'A new activity period will not be identified until it is already ongoing. In any case, these observations of the quiet phase we are now analysing are clearly during a period when activity is at its lowest. Now we are waiting for a new rise in activity.'\n\nSolar storms can cause danger\n\nOn the Earth, solar activity can be seen as auroras, for example. Solar activity can even cause major damage, as solar storms caused by solar flares can damage satellites, electricity networks and radio frequency communications. Research helps to prepare for such damage.\n\n'In solar storms, it takes 2 to 3 days before the particles hit the Earth.

In the Large Magellanic Cloud, 167,644 light-years away, astronomers watched as a massive star died in a spectacular supernova, the closest to Earth in hundreds of years.\n\nBut when the fireworks died down, something was missing. There was no sign of the neutron star that should have been left behind.\n\nNow, 33 years later, astronomers have finally caught a glimpse of that dead star, gleaming out from a thick cloud of obscuring dust at the centre of the supernova remnant - the glowing debris of its own stellar viscera.\n\nMulti-wavelength images of SN1987A, with the yellow blob in the centre of the composite image suggested to be the neutron star NS 1987A. (ALMA [ESO\/NAOJ\/NRAO], P. Cigan and R. Indebetouw; NRAO\/AUI\/NSF, B. Saxton; NASA\/ESA)\n\nThere are several types of supernovae, depending on the type of star dying. Those that produce a neutron star - Type II supernovae - start with a star between eight and 30 times the mass of the Sun, which becomes increasingly unstable as it runs out of elements to support nuclear fusion.\n\nFinally, it explodes, ejecting its outer material and spewing light and neutrinos out across space, while the core collapses down into a neutron star.\n\nIn the case of 1987's supernova, everything occurred just as expected. An old blue supergiant star called Sanduleak -69 202, about 20 times the mass of the Sun, went kaboom in a spectacular lightshow - so bright it was visible to the naked eye - corresponding with a neutrino shower detected here on Earth.\n\nThe event left behind a glowing supernova remnant named SN 1987A. But at the centre, astronomers could find no trace of the expected newborn neutron star.\n\nThen, in November of last year, a team of researchers led by Phil Cigan of Cardiff University in the UK announced that they had finally found a hot, bright blob in the remnant's core using the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array in Chile. It was, they said, consistent with a neutron star shrouded by a thick cloud of dust.\n\n\"We were very surprised to see this warm blob made by a thick cloud of dust in the supernova remnant. There has to be something in the cloud that has heated up the dust and which makes it shine. That's why we suggested that there is a neutron star hiding inside the dust cloud,\" explained astrophysicist Mikako Matsuura of Cardiff University.\n\nBut there was still a problem. Whatever it was glowing inside the blob, it looked like it might perhaps be too bright to be a neutron star.\n\nThat's where a team led by astrophysicist Dany Page of the National Autonomous University of Mexico comes in. Page had been a PhD student when Sanduleak -69 202 went kablooey, and he has been studying SN 1987A ever since.\n\nIn a new paper, Page and his team have theoretically demonstrated that the glowy blob can indeed be a neutron star. Its brightness is consistent with thermal emission from a very young neutron star - in other words, it's still really, really hot from the supernova explosion. They have named the neutron star NS 1987A.\n\n\"In spite of the supreme complexity of a supernova explosion and the extreme conditions reigning in the interior of a neutron star, the detection of a warm blob of dust is a confirmation of several predictions,\" Page said.\n\nThe heat - around 5 million degrees Celsius (9 million degrees Fahrenheit) - is one of those predictions. Another is the star's location. It's not exactly at the centre of the supernova, but travelling away from it at a velocity of up to 700 kilometres per second (435 miles per second).\n\nThis is not unusual at all - if a supernova explosion is uneven, it can boot the collapsed stellar core out across the galaxy, at absolutely insane speeds.\n\nThe team also compared the observations with other possible scenarios, such as the radioactive decay of isotopes. They also examined the fit for a pulsar - a type of rapidly spinning, pulsing neutron star - or a black hole. None of these explanations fit the data as well as a normal neutron star.\n\nAccording to the team's analysis, NS 1987A would be around 25 kilometres across, and around 1.38 times the mass of the Sun - all extremely normal for a neutron star.\n\nBut it's also the youngest neutron star we've ever seen - the next youngest is inside supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, which is 11,000 light-years away, and which exploded in the 17th century - meaning it can offer invaluable insights into this metamorphic stage of stellar evolution.\n\n\"The neutron star behaves exactly like we expected,\" said astronomer James Lattimer of Stony Brook University.\n\n\"Those neutrinos suggested that a black hole never formed, and moreover it seems difficult for a black hole to explain the observed brightness of the blob. We compared all possibilities and concluded that a hot neutron star is the most likely explanation.\"\n\nBecause the putative neutron star is still shrouded in dust, the direct observation that would confirm this finding is, at the moment, impossible. Astronomers are going to be watching it for decades to come to see what emerges from that cloudy chrysalis.\n\nThe research has been published in The Astrophysical Journal."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.sciencealert.com\/otherworldly-jellyfish-sprite-lightning-was-captured-in-a-stunning-photo","domain":"sciencealert.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 01:31:53","title":"Photographer Captures Eerie And Majestic Sky 'Jellyfish' During a Storm","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.sciencealert.com\/images\/2020-08\/5f372a5de89ebf001f044fb01.jpg","content":"If you've ever looked up during a thunderstorm and glimpsed a red jellyfish sitting high in the sky, you weren't hallucinating.\n\nThese tentacle-like spurts of red lightning are called sprites. They're ultrafast bursts of electricity that crackle through the upper regions of the atmosphere \u2013 between 37 and 50 miles (60 and 80 kilometres) up in the sky \u2013 and move towards space, according to the European Space Agency.\n\nThe phenomenon is a rare sighting: It lasts just tenths of a second and can be hard to see from the ground since it's generally obscured by storm clouds. But Stephen Hummel, a dark-skies specialist at the McDonald Observatory, captured a spectacular image of one of these sprites on July 2 (shown above) from a ridge on Mount Locke in Texas.\n\n\"Sprites usually appear to the eye as very brief, dim, grey structures. You need to be looking for them to spot them, and oftentimes I am not certain I actually saw one until I check the camera footage to confirm,\" Hummel told Business Insider.\n\nOn the night he snapped this photo, he'd recorded 4 1\/2 hours of footage before capturing the sprite on film.\n\n\"Overall I've probably recorded close to 70 hours' worth of footage and stills this year, and caught about 70 sprites,\" he said, adding that half of those were in a single storm.\n\nMcDonald Observatory specialist captured the jellyfish sprite lightning. (Stephen Hummel)\n\nJellyfish sprites can be seen glimpsed from space\n\nDavis Sentman, a professor of physics at the University of Alaska who died in 2011, proposed the name \"sprite\" for this type of weather phenomenon. He said the name was \"well suited to describe their appearance\", since the word evokes the lightning's fairy-like, fleeting nature.\n\nSome sprites, like the one Hummel photographed, are jellyfish-shaped. Others are just vertical columns of red light with tendrils snaking down: these are called carrot sprites.\n\nJellyfish sprites can be enormous \u2013 the one Hummel photographed was \"probably around 30 miles long and 30 miles tall,\" he said. Some can be seen from more than 300 miles (500 kilometres) away.\n\nThey occur because when lightning strikes the ground, it tends to release positive electrical energy that needs to be balanced out by equal and oppositely charged energy elsewhere in the sky. So sprites are the electrical discharges that balance the equation.\n\n\"The more powerful the storm and the more lightning it produces, the more likely it is to produce a sprite,\" Hummel said.\n\nWhile similar to regular lightning, which shoots between electrically charged air, clouds, and the ground, sprites happen much farther from Earth's surface.\n\nAstronauts sometimes spot them from the International Space Station.\n\nAstronauts glimpse lightning sprite from the International Space Station, August 2015. (NASA)\n\nAs a sprite sparks, it turns red because of nitrogen floating high in Earth's atmosphere.

They discovered that these troughs are concentrically distributed across almost the entire surface of the satellite. This global distribution indicates that these troughs may be actually part of one giant crater covering Ganymede.\n\nBased on the results of a computer simulation conducted using the \u201cPC Cluster\u201d at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), it is speculated that this giant crater could have resulted from the impact of an asteroid with a radius of 150km. If so, the structure is the largest impact structure identified in the solar system so far.\n\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) mission, which will be launched in 2022 and arrive in Jupiter\u2019s system in 2029, aims to increase our knowledge regarding Jupiter\u2019s satellites, including Ganymede. It is hoped that this exploration will confirm the results of this study and further advance our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter\u2019s satellites.\n\nThe research team consisted of Kobe University Graduate School of Science\u2019s Assistant Professor HIRATA Naoyuki and Professor OHTSUKI Keiji (both of the Department of Planetology), and Associate Professor SUETSUGU Ryo of National Institute of Technology, Oshima College. The paper for this study was published online in Icarus on July 15.\n\nMain Points\n\nMany furrows, or trough formations, have been previously observed on the surface of Ganymede, one of Jupiter\u2019s moons.\n\nThe research group comprehensively reanalyzed image data of Ganymede\u2019s surface obtained by NASA\u2019s Voyager 1, Voyager 2 and Galileo spacecraft.\n\nThe results revealed that almost all of these furrows on the surface of Ganymede appear to be in concentric rings centered at a single point, indicating that this global multiring structure may be the remains of a giant crater.\n\nThe radial extent of the multiring measured along the satellite\u2019s surface is 7800km. Therefore, if it is actually formed by an impact, it is the largest vestigial impact crater discovered in the solar system so far.\n\nThe results of the numerical impact simulation indicated that an asteroid with a radius of 150km impacting Ganymede at a speed of 20km\/s would explain the observed structures on the satellite\u2019s surface.\n\nResearch Background\n\nBoth Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 have closely approached Ganymede in 1979 and 1980 respectively, taking detailed images of the surface. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, obtaining a large amount of Ganymede image data. Ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system and is bigger than both Pluto and Mercury. The formation and evolution of Jupiter\u2019s moons including Ganymede is strongly connected to the formation and evolution of the Jupiter system, and by extension, of the solar system. Consequently, there are various ongoing and planned spacecraft missions to explore the satellite system, including NASA\u2019s JUNO mission that is ongoing, the Europa Clipper scheduled to perform a detailed investigation of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa in around 2030, and the aforementioned JUICE mission.\n\nThe study was conducted with the aims of clarifying one aspect of the formation and evolution of Jupiter\u2019s satellites and of contributing towards these spacecraft missions. The group reanalyzed image data of Ganymede. In particular, the researchers focused on furrows, tectonic troughs that are believed to be the oldest surface features on the satellite. Therefore, the research group hypothesized that they could reconstruct the early history of Ganymede by analyzing these geological formations.\n\nResearch Findings\n\nGanymede\u2019s surface is categorized into areas of Dark Terrain and Bright Terrain. Dark Terrain is extremely old and has many remaining craters, as well as trough formations. Bright Terrain is comparatively recent, with hardly any craters. These two types of terrain are not coherently arranged and are randomly distributed over Ganymede\u2019s entirety. Furrows are believed to be Ganymede\u2019s oldest geological features because they are only found on Dark Terrain and many impact craters have been formed on top of them later on.\n\nThis study reanalyzed the distribution of these trough formations over Ganymede\u2019s entire surface, revealing for the first time that almost all of these furrows are concentrically aligned around a single point. The study showed that these furrows form giant, concentric rings over the entire satellite. From this, it can be assumed that there was a giant multiring impact crater which covered the entire surface of Ganymede before the formation of the Bright Terrain areas. A similar ring structure known as the Valhalla Crater remains on the surface of Callisto, another satellite of Jupiter. Until now, the Valhalla Crater has been the largest identified multiring crater in the solar system, with a radius of approximately 1900km. However, the multiring crater on Ganymede has a radial extent of 7800km measured along the satellite\u2019s surface.\n\nThe research team conducted a simulation to estimate the scale of the impact that formed this giant crater. This was carried out using the \u201cPC Cluster\u201d at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). The results indicated that an asteroid with a radius of 150km impacting Ganymede at a speed of 20km\/s would be sufficient to form the observed structures on the satellite\u2019s surface. It is believed that such an impact occurred around 40 million years ago.\n\nFurther Developments\n\nThe discovery that the aftermath of a large-scale impact remains on Ganymede\u2019s surface is greatly significant in terms of the satellite\u2019s formation process and evolution. For example, Jupiter\u2019s satellite Callisto is around the same size as Ganymede, however it is believed that it doesn\u2019t have an internal structure composed of differentiated layers. On the other hand, Ganymede is thought to be composed of a differentiated layer structure consisting of rock, iron and ice. An enormous amount of heat is necessary to form these differentiated layers. It is possible that the aforementioned large-scale impact could have been the source of this heat.\n\nThis study\u2019s discovery will also have substantial significance for the Ganymede exploration programs scheduled in the coming decades.

Rather, it's some strange amalgamation of all three.\n\nAccording to the authors of the new study, the animal's genomic architecture is unlike anything previously reported.\n\n\"The tuatara genome contained about 4 percent jumping genes that are common in reptiles, about 10 percent common in monotremes (platypus and echidna) and less than 1 percent common in placental mammals such as humans,\" says biologist David Adelson from the University of Adelaide, Australia.\n\n\"This was a highly unusual observation and indicated that the tuatara genome is an odd combination of both mammalian and reptilian [including bird] components.\"\n\nScientists already knew the tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) was something else, but this new research suggests it's even more unique than we suspected.\n\nFound solely in New Zealand, the tuatara - which does greatly resemble a lizard to the untrained eye - is considered a taonga, or 'special treasure' for the local M\u0101ori. And for good reason.\n\nThese nocturnal creatures can live for a century, withstand super cold temperatures, hold their breath for as long as an hour, and see light out of a third 'parietal eye' on their heads.\n\nToday, the species' closest relatives are snakes and lizards, but to call them relatives is a bit like calling a kangaroo a relative of humans. Their common ancestor actually goes back some 250 million years.\n\nThroughout that huge amount of time, tuatara have remained the sole members of the archaic reptilian order known as Rhynchocephalia.\n\n\"This species represents an important link to the now-extinct stem reptiles from which dinosaurs, modern reptiles, birds and mammals evolved, and is thus important for our understanding of amniote evolution,\" the research team writes in their paper.\n\nThe tuatara retains features of the ancient and long-extinct animals from which all these groups evolved from. The researchers that sequenced its genome note this species is the slowest-evolving reptile yet analysed, more so than any other lizard or snake.\n\nAs such, tuatara are a direct line back to our origins, but their continued existence on our planet is not a sure bet.\n\nWhile their numbers are doing okay now, as tuatara are protected on all 35 islands they are found on in New Zealand, a rapidly changing climate could spell their eventual doom.\n\nThe sex of future tuatara depends heavily on the temperature surrounding the eggs, and global warming could lead to too many males being born, sending the reproductive cycle into an imbalance.\n\nThe authors of the new study say tuatara \"remain imperilled owing to their highly restricted distribution, threats imposed by disease and changes in sex ratios induced by climate change that could markedly affect their survival.\"\n\nKnowing more about the species is crucial for its continued survival. But this genomics research is important for other reasons, too.\n\nThe research was done in partnership with the Ng\u0101tiwai, the M\u0101ori iwi (tribe) who hold kaitiakitanga (guardianship) over the tuatara populations; this sort of collaboration is not always considered in conservation research.\n\n\"This partnership - which, to our knowledge, is unique among the genome projects undertaken to date - had a strong practical focus on developing resources and information that will improve our understanding of the tuatara and aid in future conservation efforts,\" the authors write.\n\n\"It is hoped that this work will form an exemplar for future genome initiatives that aspire to meet access and benefit-sharing obligations to Indigenous communities.\"\n\nSharing knowledge is important, as is sharing credit.

But for the mysterious lifeforms that lurk deep under the seafloor of Earth\u2019s oceans\u2014a sunless habitat with hardly any fuel sources\u2014being \u201clow energy\u201d is a matter of survival.\n\nNow, a team of scientists has discovered that these otherworldly creatures \u201csubsist at energy fluxes lower than have previously been shown to support life, calling into question the power limit to life,\u201d according to a study published on Wednesday in Science Advances.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nTo put it in perspective, the energy budget of an average human could power a ceiling fan. These organisms exist on an energy budget about 50 quintillion (a billion billion) times smaller than that, according to the study. In effect, we have just discovered that certain lifeforms can be so incredibly inactive that it has expanded our conception of what life on Earth, and elsewhere in the cosmos, can look like.\n\n\u201cWe have this habitat in the sediments underneath the seafloor that previously was unknown to us until just a few decades ago,\u201d said lead author James Bradley, an environmental scientist at Queen Mary University of London, in a call.\n\n\u201cThis is thought to be a very energy-limiting environment, but it contains a vast amount of microbial life,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe number of cells that are contained in global subseafloor sediments is equivalent to the number of cells in all of Earth\u2019s soils, or all of Earth\u2019s global ocean.\u201d\n\nScientists first stumbled upon the existence of this deep subsurface biosphere decades ago by drilling cores across the globe, from coastal regions to the open ocean. These expeditions have revealed that life, in the form of intact microbial cells, has found its way into niches that can be kilometers under the seafloor.\n\nBradley and his colleagues used global datasets from these seafloor surveys to calculate the energy budgets of these frugal lifeforms. The team\u2019s numerical model focused on how the ecosystems digest particles of organic carbon\u2014mostly the remains of dead stuff\u2014that rain down on the seafloor from higher levels of the ocean.\n\n\u201cWe have good evidence to believe that the oxidation of organic carbon, the burning of this organic matter, is the primary fuel source for life in the subsurface,\u201d Bradley explained. \u201cIt\u2019s a system cut off from light and it relies on the input of this sinking organic material onto the seafloor, and then its eventual burial and deposition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe used numerical modeling to predict the flow of energy through the system, the number of cells that are there, and the rate of organic carbon that has degraded, which supplies, in part, the energy,\u201d he said.\n\nYour own energy needs, assuming you are a human, are about equal to the power required to run a ceiling fan. Bradley\u2019s team found that the average seabed cell has an energy budget that\u2019s about 50 quintillion (a billion billion) times smaller than that, according to the study.\n\nAs you can imagine, life in these dark regions moves at a very different pace to our lush surface world. In the subsurface, microbial living cells often exist in a kind of suspended animation that may span millions of years.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the majority of these organisms are living at energy regimes that are below what we thought was even capable of maintenance\u2014just staying alive\u2014so the idea that there might be widespread growth and cell division seems not very likely,\u201d Bradley said.\n\n\u201cAre these the same cells, or at least only a few generations removed from those that were deposited tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of years ago?\u201d he added. \u201cI think that is still an open question.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s mind-boggling that we share a planet with life forms that can eke out basic biological activities with so little fuel in the tank. But it also sheds light on the potential habitability of other worlds in the solar system, such as Mars or Europa, as well as the odds that exoplanets orbiting other stars might bear life.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing through this study is that these organisms have a very fundamentally different relationship with energy than most of life that we\u2019re familiar with,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cIf it\u2019s possible that organisms can survive over extremely long timescales on very little energy, that definitely expands the possible habitats that we might search for life in.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a tantalizing reality to ponder with regards to worlds like Mars, which scientists think was potentially habitable to microbes more than three billion years ago. Perhaps microbial Martians retreated into the subsurface eons ago, and have laid in wait for eons in case friendlier conditions return to the red planet.\n\nNobody knows, of course, but it\u2019s an encouraging sign that the deep biosphere, which is as alien an ecosystem as you can get on Earth, is teeming with weird ancient life. The team\u2019s findings cover sediments that date back 2.6 million years, but scientists hope to recover more samples that may push that date back upwards of 50 or 100 million years.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to be able to expand this numerical framework to be able to capture those environments,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cWe would expect to find that the more ancient environments are subsisting at the same or lower energy regimes to what we find here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we continue to explore sites that are more difficult to access, sites that are hotter, sites that have been cut off from the sort of dynamic parts of the Earth for longer timescales, we might start to see areas where we don\u2019t find life,\u201d he concluded. \u201cBut so far, the majority of the places that we\u2019ve looked we\u2019ve found these zombie-like cells.\u201d"},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/science\/1322750\/yellowstone-volcano-eruption-tracker-how-many-times-yellowstone-erupted-usgs-map","domain":"express.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-14 08:39:51","title":"Yellowstone volcano eruption tracker: How many times has Yellowstone erupted?

Now, a new study has confirmed that these fossilized remains belonged to a pre-historic owl that lived on the earth 55 million years ago.\n\nOwl's Unique Hunting Feet\n\nResearchers have named these ancient owls, Primoptynx poliotauros, and they measured nearly 20 inches in length. According to researchers, these owls had a size very similar to the modern-day snow owl. Owls in the modern days use their beaks and toes to trap and kill enemies. But what makes Primoptynx poliotauros different from their modern counterparts was their unique hunting feet.\n\n\"Owls today have four toes with claws of equal size to catch relatively small prey and kill them with the beak. Primoptynx has a longer first and second toe, as seen in hawks and other members of the family Accipitridae. Those more developed toes are used to pin down prey, which is punctured by the talons. So it was an owl that hunted like a hawk on medium-sized mammals,\" said Thierry Smith, the co-author of the study.\n\nHunting Habit of these Ancient Owls\n\nIn an interview given to Live Science, Smith revealed that Primoptynx had hunted down mammals and primates lived on trees and grounds.\n\nGerald Mayr, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum suggested that more studies should be conducted to know how owls evolved as creatures that hunt using beaks when compared to their old style of attacking prey using feet.\n\n\"We assume that it may be related to the spread of diurnal birds of prey in the late Eocene and early Oligocene, approximately 34 million years ago. Competition for prey with diurnal birds of prey may have triggered feeding specializations in owls, possibly also leading to these charismatic birds' nocturnal habits,\" added Mayr."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.courant.com\/pets\/sns-nyt-terror-crocodile-fed-on-dinosaurs-20200816-77g2fxmbjfe5jj2lyjfxaukg74-story.html","domain":"courant.com","published_date":"2020-08-16 12:43:07","title":"\u2018Terror crocodile\u2019 the size of a bus fed on dinosaurs, study says","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.courant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/hartford.png","content":"They had teeth the size of bananas, were as long as buses and limos, and preyed on dinosaurs that fed near their waterways.\n\nThose are among some of the findings presented in a new study announced this week about an enormous ancient animal called the \u201cterror crocodile,\u201d or Deinosuchus.\n\nThe research, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, found that the Deinosuchus, a lineage of the giant crocodilians from North America, grew up to 33 feet long and \u201cwas the largest carnivore in its ecosystem,\u201d in the late Cretaceous period about 75 million to 82 million years ago.\n\nAdam Cossette, a vertebrate paleobiologist who led the study, said in an email Tuesday that while it was difficult to determine their average size because there were so few known specimens, \u201cthe specimens that we do have are all HUGE.\u201d\n\nCossette, of the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine of Arkansas State University, said that large specimens were 30 to 35 feet long and weighed about 8,000 pounds. For comparison, he said that a large American alligator today is about 12 to 13 feet long, weighs about 700 to 800 pounds, and has teeth about 3 inches long at the tip of its snout.\n\nHe also said that the ancient reptiles had a large enough head and strong enough jaws to prey on dinosaurs that lived among them.\n\n\u201cDeinosuchus was a giant that must have terrorized dinosaurs that came to the water\u2019s edge to drink,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cUntil now, the complete animal was unknown. These new specimens we\u2019ve examined reveal a bizarre, monstrous predator.\u201d\n\nIn addition to killing dinosaurs, the animals, because of their size, probably preyed on just about anything that wandered their way. Researchers found multiple bite marks on turtle shells and dinosaur bones.\n\nThey also found that at least three species of the Deinosuchus roamed what is now the United States and Mexico. Two species lived in the West, from Montana to northern Mexico, and another species lived along the Atlantic coastal plain, from New Jersey to Mississippi.\n\nThe study said that despite the name of the genus, which means \u201cterror crocodile,\u201d the creatures were more closely related to alligators.

The study was published Thursday (US time) in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nBetelgeuse is a nearby, aging red supergiant star in the Orion constellation about 725 light-years away. It's one of the brightest stars in our sky.\n\nThis graphic shows why Betelgeuse grew so dim between fall 2019 and February 2020. (NASA\/ESA\/E. Wheatley)\n\nAs the star burns through fuel in its core, it has swollen to massive proportions. If it were at the centre of our solar system, instead of the sun, the star's outer surface would go beyond Jupiter's orbit.\n\nThe star has fascinated astronomers for a long time. Because they've observed it so much, the scientists expect it to go through a dimming and brightening cycle every 420 days.\n\nBut Betelgeuse caught the attention of astronomers around the world in the fall of 2019 when it began to dim unexpectedly and continued through February. But then, its brightness dipped by two-thirds and the change was visible to the naked eye.\n\nIt was the faintest the star had been since measurements of it began 150 years ago.\n\nAstronomers thought it might signify that Betelgeuse may be about to explode in a supernova and continued observing the star. It returned to its normal brightness by April. So, what happened?\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope observed Betelgeuse in ultraviolet light beginning in January 2019, so it was able to contribute information for the star's timeline leading up to its dimming event.\n\nAstronomers looking through the Hubble data saw dense material that had been heated moving through the star's atmosphere in fall 2019, from September to November.\n\nHubble clocked the material moving at 321,869km\/h. In December, observations provided by ground-based telescopes revealed the star experienced a particular dip in brightness concentrated in its southern hemisphere.\n\nThe superheated plasma was released from the star through a large convection cell, like hot bubbles rising in boiling water \u2013 except hundreds of times the size of our sun.\n\nWhen the star ejected this large amount of hot material comprised of gases, the material cooled as it reached the star's outer layers and formed a dust cloud that blocked starlight from about a quarter of the star's surface.\n\n\"With Hubble, we see the material as it left the star's visible surface and moved out through the atmosphere, before the dust formed that caused the star to appear to dim,\" Andrea Dupree, lead researcher and associate director of The Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian, said in a statement.\n\n\"Only Hubble gives us this evidence of what led up to the dimming.\"\n\nWhat's next for Betelgeuse?\n\nHubble has been used to analyse Betelgeuse as part of a three-year study using the telescope to study how the star's outer atmosphere varies.\n\nHubble's ultraviolet capability allows it to see the hottest layers of the star, which can't be seen in visible light. These layers exceed 11,093 degrees Celsius.\n\nAstronomers are unsure what caused the ejection of the star's material in the first place, but it may have had something to do with Betelgeuse's normal cycle of dimming and brightening, which is called pulsating.\n\nBut the way Betelgeuse is losing material, including the loss of two times the normal amount of material coming just from its southern hemisphere, is unusual.\n\n\"All stars are losing material to the interstellar medium, and we don't know how this material is lost,\" Ms Dupree said.\n\n\"We know that other hotter luminous stars lose material and it quickly turns to dust making the star appear much fainter. But in over a century-and-a-half, this has not happened to Betelgeuse. It's very unique.\"\n\nWhen Betelgeuse moved out of Hubble's view, astronomers used NASA's Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory spacecraft, or STEREO, to keep an eye on its brightness. And observations from this summer show the star is experiencing unexpected dimming again.\n\n\"Betelgeuse typically goes through brightness cycles lasting around 420 days, and since the previous minimum happened in February 2020, this new dimming is over a year early,\" Ms Dupree said.\n\nSome astronomers speculate that the star's behaviour is a precursor to a supernova.\n\nBetelgeuse will eventually end its life and explode in a supernova \u2013 even if it doesn't occur during our lifetime. Astronomically speaking, however, given the distance of the star, this current dimming event happened in 1300 \u2013 but we're only able to observe these changes to the star now.\n\nDupree and her fellow scientists will observe Betelgeuse more in late August and early September.\n\n\"No one knows how a star behaves in the weeks before it explodes, and there were some ominous predictions that Betelgeuse was ready to become a supernova,\" Ms Dupree said."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/science\/astronomers-spot-glowing-butterfly-in-deep-space","domain":"foxnews.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 11:15:23","title":"Astronomers spot glowing 'butterfly' in deep space","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/static.foxnews.com\/foxnews.com\/content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/896\/500\/ngc-2899.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","content":"Astronomers have spotted a \"butterfly\" in deep space.\n\nThe bubble of gas, known as NGC 2899, was spotted between 3,000 and 6,500 light-years away, in the Southern constellation of Vela (The Sails).

They're still not exactly sure how that happened.\n\nThe discovery is detailed in a study published Monday in the journal Nature, and provides new clues that may prove to be helpful in bettering our understanding of how cosmic rays are produced in the universe.\n\nThe gas cloud pulsates at the same rhythm as a distant quasar with a black hole at its center. DESY, Science Communication Lab\n\n\"Like water in the whirl above the drain of a bathtub\" \u2014 Located around 15,000 light-years away from Earth in the Milky Way galaxy, a black hole orbits a giant star in a micro-quasar system dubbed SS 433. A quasar is an extremely bright, active galactic nucleus with a supermassive black hole at its center. SS 433 appears as a scaled-down version of a quasar.\n\nThe star is around 30 times more massive than the Sun, and the black hole is around 10 to 20 solar masses.\n\nThe two objects are orbiting each other during a period of 13 days, as the black hole gobbles up matter from the giant star.\n\n\u201cThis material accumulates in an accretion disc before falling into the black hole, like water in the whirl above the drain of a bathtub,\u201d co-author Jian Li, a fellow at the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY), explains. \u201cHowever, a part of that matter does not fall down the drain but shoots out at high speed in two narrow jets in opposite directions above and below the rotating accretion disk.\u201d\n\nThe accretion disc is not precisely situated in the plane of the orbit of the star and its accompanying black hole, causing it to sway like a spinning top. As a result, the two streaming jets spiral their way into space rather than beaming out into two straight lines.\n\nThe precession, or wobbling, of the jets has a period of around 162 days. Fascinatingly, about 100 light-years away from SS 433, astronomers detected a gamma-ray, or electromagnetic radiation, signal from a cosmic gas cloud with the same period of time. This gas cloud is known as Fermi J1913+0515.\n\nScientists believe that the black hole is somehow powering the gamma-ray emission by the cloud because they both following the same rhythm \u2014 but how and why this is possible still needs to be confirmed.\n\n\u201cFinding such an unambiguous connection via timing, about 100 light-years away from the microquasar, not even along the direction of the jets is as unexpected as amazing,\u201d Li said. \u201cBut how the black hole can power the gas cloud's heartbeat is unclear to us.\u201d\n\nFurther observations are needed in order to determine the main cause behind this unlikely synchronized duo, but scientists do have one theory so far: They believe that the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms produced at the end of the black hole's jets are causing the gamma-ray emissions.\n\n\u201cSS 433 continues to amaze observers at all frequencies and theoreticians alike,\u201d Li said. \u201cAnd it is certain to provide a testbed for our ideas on cosmic-ray production and propagation near microquasars for years to come.\u201d\n\nAbstract: Microquasars, the local siblings of extragalactic quasars, are binary systems comprising a compact object and a companion star. By accreting matter from their companions, microquasars launch powerful winds and jets, influencing the interstellar environment around them. Steady gamma-ray emission is expected to rise from their central objects, or from interactions between their outflows and the surrounding medium. The latter prediction was recently confirmed with the detection of SS 433 at high (TeV) energies1. In this report, we analyse more than ten years of gigaelectronvolt gamma-ray data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope on this source. Detailed scrutiny of the data reveal emission in the vicinity of SS 433, co-spatial with a gas enhancement, and hints of emission possibly associated with a terminal lobe of one of the jets. Both gamma-ray excesses are relatively far from the central binary, and the former shows evidence of a periodic variation at the precessional period of SS 433, linking it with the microquasar. This result challenges obvious interpretations and is unexpected from previously published theoretical models. It provides us with a chance to unveil the particle transport from SS 433 and to probe the structure of the magnetic field in its vicinity."},{"topic":"SCIENCE","link":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2020\/08\/10\/how-watch-perseids-meteor-shower-august-11-12-2020\/3300174001\/","domain":"usatoday.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 10:00:44","title":"The Perseids are the best meteor shower of the summer.

That\u2019s according to a new study by researchers at Ohio State University.\n\n\u201cThe ice sheet is now in this new dynamic state, where even if we went back to a climate that was more like what we had 20 or 30 years ago, we would still be pretty quickly losing mass,\u201d Ian Howat, co-author of the study and a professor at Ohio State University, said.\n\nGreenland\u2019s ice sheet dumps more than 280 billion metric tons of melting ice into the ocean each year, making it the greatest single contributor to global sea level rise, according to Michalea King, the lead author of the study and researcher at Ohio State University.\n\nThe ice loss has been so massive in recent years, she said, that it has caused a measurable change in the gravitational field over Greenland.\n\nILULISSAT, GREENLAND - In this aerial view melting ice forms a lake on free-floating ice jammed into the Ilulissat Icefjord during unseasonably warm weather on July 30, 2019 near Ilulissat, Greenland. Sean Gallup\/Getty Images\n\nIce melting in Greenland contributes more than a millimeter rise to sea level every year, and that\u2019s likely to get worse. Sea levels are projected to rise by more than 3 feet by the end of the century, wiping away beaches and coastal properties.\n\nCoastal states like Florida, and low-lying island nations are particularly vulnerable. Just 3 feet of sea level rise could put large areas of coastline underwater. Forty percent of the US population resides in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea level rise.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of places, like in Florida especially, where one meter alone would cover a lot of existing land areas,\u201d King said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exacerbated when you get storms and hurricanes and things like that, that then cause extra surge on top of a higher baseline.\u201d\n\nThe study also found that the ice sheet is retreating in rapid bursts, leading to a sudden and unpredictable rise in sea levels, making it difficult to prepare for the effects.\n\nThe study used four decades of satellite data to measure changes in Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. The authors found that after 2000, the ice sheet shrank so rapidly that replenishing snowfall would not keep up with the rate of melting from parts of the glacier newly exposed to warmer ocean water, even if climate change were reversed.\n\nEntire coasts of ice are retreating at once due to climate change, Howat said, adding that all 200 glaciers that make up the Greenland ice sheet have been observed retreating within the same episode.\n\nEven though the retreat of the Greenland Ice sheet likely cannot be reversed, it\u2019s just the first in a series of tipping points. If climate change continues at this rate, the rate of melting will get much worse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve passed the point of no return but there\u2019s obviously more to come,\u201d Howat said. \u201cRather than being a single tipping point in which we\u2019ve gone from a happy ice sheet to a rapidly collapsing ice sheet, it\u2019s more of a staircase where we\u2019ve fallen off the first step but there\u2019s many more steps to go down into the pit.\u201d"},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/football-talk.co.uk\/158410\/tottenham-eye-35m-double-swoop-as-mourinho-targets-move-to-sign-28-year-old-star\/","domain":"football-talk.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-07 10:57:15","title":"Tottenham eye \u00a335m double swoop as Mourinho targets move to sign 28-year-old star","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/football-talk.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/callum-wilson-750x450.jpg","content":"Tottenham are now targeting a move to sign Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson after agreeing a deal with Southampton for Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, according to the Daily Star.\n\nJose Mourinho knows he needs to strengthen his squad if Tottenham are to get back into the top four next season and the Portuguese coach is on the verge of making Hojbjerg his first major signing of the summer.\n\nThe Daily Star are one of several outlets claiming that the midfielder will join Tottenham after a \u00a315m deal was agreed with Southampton \u2013 although the price could increase if performance-related add-ons are triggered.\n\nThe newspaper report says Hojbjerg has already agreed personal terms over the move to north London so it\u2019s just a matter of time before the 25-year-old will be unveiled as a Tottenham player.\n\nMourinho wanted more competition in midfield as doubts continue over Tanguy Ndombele following a disappointing first season at Spurs and Hojbjerg will challenge the likes of Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko for a first team place.\n\nMourinho is also in the market for another striker to support Harry Kane as Tottenham have been far too reliant on the England international in recent years and it looks like Wilson has emerged as a target.\n\nThe Daily Star claims Spurs have turned their attention to signing the Bournemouth hitman and are favourites ahead of West Ham and Newcastle United to get a deal done this summer.\n\nWilson has reportedly informed Bournemouth he wants to leave following their relegation from the top flight but the Daily Star says the Cherries won\u2019t sell on the cheap and want around \u00a320m for his signature.\n\nNo doubt Spurs will look to drive the price down as the report says Wilson is keen to secure a move to the capital but the 28-year-old would be an excellent signing if Tottenham can get a deal agreed this summer.\n\nWilson has scored 67 goals in 180 appearances for Bournemouth since joining the club from Coventry in 2014 and has represented England at international level so he should be a solid back-up for Kane if Spurs can get a deal over the line.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see how things develop over the coming days but it looks like Tottenham could be ready to spend around \u00a335m on two new signings and I think Hojbjerg and Wilson would both be solid additions to their squad."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.foxsports.com\/stories\/nba\/nba-announces-bubble-awards","domain":"foxsports.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 16:04:44","title":"NBA Announces Bubble Awards","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/a57.foxsports.com\/statics.foxsports.com\/www.foxsports.com\/content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/500\/281\/2024-10-18-nba.jpg?ve=1&tl=1, https:\/\/a57.foxsports.com\/statics.foxsports.com\/www.foxsports.com\/content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/1000\/562\/2024-10-18-nba.jpg?ve=1&tl=1 2x","content":"National Basketball Association NBA Announces Bubble Awards Updated Aug. 11, 2020 9:31 p.m. ET share facebook x reddit link\n\nThe NBA's regular season awards might not factor in bubble performances, but there will be recognition for the players who showed up and showed out in Orlando.\n\nThe NBA said Tuesday that it will name both a bubble MVP and an All-Bubble team, voted on by the media.\n\nAnd with that, here are a few of the names that have stood out in the bubble so far:\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDamian Lillard, Portland\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers entered the bubble fighting for their playoff lives. However, they are officially in 8th place after Tuesday's win over Dallas.\n\nAnd superstar point guard Damian Lillard has been the catalyst.\n\nAfter scoring 51 in Sunday's win over Philadelphia, Lillard dropped 61 on Tuesday, leading the Blazers to a 5-2 record so far. He also scored 45 in a win over Denver last Thursday, and is now averaging 37.0 in the bubble.\n\nAccording to FOX Bet, Lillard's odds of winning bubble MVP are set at +350.\n\nJames Harden, Houston\n\nHarden was the league's leading scorer when the season was interrupted in March and he has picked up right where he left off in Orlando.\n\nIn five bubble outings, Harden is averaging 33.4 points, including a 49-point showing in a win over Dallas on July 31 and a 39-point outing in a win over the Lakers last Thursday. Houston is 4-1 in those games.\n\nIn addition, this past week, Harden was named a finalist for the regular season NBA MVP award.\n\nDevin Booker, Phoenix\n\nDevin Booker made his first All-Star appearance this season, while shooting a career-best from the field (48.8%) and free-throw line (91.9%).\n\nBut he's taken his game to an even higher level in the bubble \u2013 just ask the Clippers.\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, Booker is avergaing 31.0 points per game in Orlando and has the Suns as the surprise of the restart with a 7-0 record, placing them as the lone remaining unbeaten team.\n\nThe Suns are currently a half game behind Memphis for the 8th seed and are tied with Portland for the 9th seed.\n\nBooker's odds for bubble MVP are currently +200.\n\nT.J. Warren, Indiana\n\nIf the Phoenix Suns are the surprise team of the bubble, Warren is the surprise individual performer.\n\nWarren has taken the bubble by storm, averaging 30.6 points, a near 11-point increase over his season average of 19.8. In six games, Warren has scored 30 or more four times, including a 53-point outburst against the Sixers on Aug. 1.\n\nWarren's odds for MVP currently sit at +175.\n\nLuka Doncic, Dallas\n\nThe 2019 NBA Rookie of the Year exploded into an early season MVP candidate this season, making his first All-Star appearance and putting up historic numbers in the process.\n\nDoncic has put together three triple-doubles in the bubble, and he is averaging 32.0 points, 11.3 assists and 11.0 rebounds in Orlando.\n\nMichael Porter Jr.\n\nMichael Porter Jr. has seen an uptick in minutes for the Denver Nuggets with both Will Barton and Gary Harris Jr. out due to lingering injuries.\n\nPorter Jr. was the top high school recruit in the country before a serious back injury derailed his freshman season at Mizzou in 2017 and caused him to slip the 14th pick in the 2018 NBA Draft.\n\nHowever, in Orlando, he has looked every bit of the highly-touted prospect he was hailed to be, averaging 23.8 points and 9.2 rebounds in six games.\n\nPorter Jr.'s odds at MVP are currently +500.\n\nshare"},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.skysports.com\/f1\/news\/12433\/12041547\/lewis-hamilton-on-max-verstappen-charles-leclerc-and-hope-for-future","domain":"skysports.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 17:03:45","title":"Lewis Hamilton on Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, and hope for closer battles in future","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/e0.365dm.com\/20\/08\/768x432\/skysports-lewis-hamilton-f1_5057016.jpg?20200803105540","content":"Lewis Hamilton says he would trade Mercedes' early F1 2020 dominance for \"super-close battles\" with Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc, who he hopes can start to challenge him again as soon as possible.\n\nVerstappen and Leclerc, two of F1's fast young stars, joined Hamilton on the podium at the British GP but only moved up a place each after Valtteri Bottas' late puncture. Before that, Mercedes - who have now won all four races to start the season - were once again streaking clear of their rivals.\n\nHamilton is 30 points clear in the championship thanks to closest rival Bottas' woe, which could be crucial with Verstappen (36 points behind) and Leclerc (55 points behind) seemingly not in title contention.\n\nBut the six-time F1 champion insists he would love to be fighting wheel-to-wheel with the Red Bull and Ferrari drivers, as he did last season.\n\n\"Honestly, look, I'm a through-and-through racer at heart,\" said Hamilton after hanging on to victory at Silverstone. \"I've grown up - particularly when you're in karting - you've got the wheel-to-wheel racing, that's what has always excited me, and that's what gets me up in the morning.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc took the top three podium spots at Silverstone\n\n\"This is not the championship fight I would have hoped for.

lure him to Stamford Bridge.\n\nIt is claimed that Chelsea, despite knowing that they face stern competition to land his signature, are desperate to add him to Frank Lampard's squad and have identified him as a player that they want.\n\nHavertz is currently valued at the \u00a375million mark and the Blues are willing to pay it, as they look to try and bridge the gap on their Premier League rivals.\n\n(Image: Mark Runnacles\/Getty Images)\n\nHaving already signed Hakim Ziyech and moving in the right direction to securing the signature of Timo Werner, the addition of Havertz would certainly be the cherry on the icing on the cake for Chelsea this summer.\n\nTransfer talks confirmed\n\nBild are reporting that talks between Chelsea and Leverkusen for Havertz are ongoing.\n\nHowever, the Blues are not the only team in the running.\n\nReal Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester United are also interested.\n\nEven Newcastle United have been mentioned.\n\nBayer Leverkusen chief drops hint\n\nBayer Leverkusen chief Fernando Carro has hinted that the German side could let Havertz depart this summer.\n\nAmid talk of a big-money switch to Chelsea, Carro has stated that player wishes to \"take the next step sometime in the near future\" as he looks to progress his game.\n\n\"Many clubs are interested in him,\" he told Kolner Stadt-Anzeiger (via Metro). \"I see the player\u2019s wish to take the next step sometime in the near future.\n\n\"You have to respect that as much as the fact that he has a contract in until 2022.\"\n\nChelsea open talks with Leverkusen for Havertz deal\n\nThe Athletic, via the Express, have reported that Chelsea have opened talks with Leverkusen to try and negotiate a deal for Havertz ahead of the summer transfer window officially opening for business.\n\nSpeculation regarding Havertz's future has been rumbling on over the past few weeks, with increasing interest in the Germany international emerging from Stamford Bridge.\n\nBlues boss Lampard is desperate to add some creativity to his midfield and Havertz would most certainly do just that.\n\nAccording to the report, Chelsea have entered negotiations with the Bundesliga club as they look to reach an agreement for the \u00a390m-rated starlet.\n\nChelsea and Real Madrid offers\n\nAccording to reports in Spain, Bayer Leverkusen have received two offers for Havertz.\n\nOne is an \u20ac80million (\u00a372.3million) offer from Real Madrid and the other is from Chelsea which is said to be in the region of \u20ac88million (\u00a379.6million).\n\nFurthermore, the report claims both clubs have offered Havertz a five-year deal, but perhaps crucially the German would earn more at Chelsea.\n\nLeverkusen and Havertz's representatives are set to mull over the offers.\n\nWill he choose the Blues?\n\nHavertz to make decision soon\n\nAccording to German publication Bild, via the Metro, Havertz will soon sit down and discuss his long-term future with Bayer Leverkusen on July 4, following the DFB Pokal final between Leverkusen and Bayern Munich.\n\nInterest is mounting as each day passes by in the German star, with both Chelsea and Bayern keen on landing his signature.\n\nHavertz is open to the idea of sealing a move to Chelsea, but only as long as they have secured Champions League football for next season.\n\nAnd the 21-year-old is happy to thrash out plans for his future once Leverkusen's season is concluded following the clash with Bayern in just over a week's time.\n\nLeverkusen are hopeful that they can retain Havertz's signature but they may face a stern battle if high offers come their way.\n\nChelsea could land Havertz in cut-price deal\n\nThe Bundesliga season reached its conclusion on Saturday afternoon and Bayer Leverkusen completed the campaign with a 1-0 home win over Mainz, with Kevin Volland netting the only goal after just two minutes.\n\nDespite concluding the season with a three-point haul, Leverkusen, as a result of Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach's win over Hertha Berlin, missed out on securing Champions League football by two points.\n\nThat means that Leverkusen, according to a reports, could now be willing to let the midfielder go for a fee nearer to \u00a370million, opposed to the \u00a390million price tag they would have demanded had they secured a top-four finish.\n\nThis is good news for Chelsea as they are understood to be happy to spend around \u00a370million on attempting to lure him to Stamford Bridge.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFollowing Saturday's win over Mainz, Leverkusen boss Peter Bosz issued an update on Havertz's future.\n\nHe said: \"I don\u2019t feel that he is thinking too much about transferring.\n\n\"I certainly don\u2019t have the impression that this will be his last game for the club. He is still under contract with us and I have to assume that he will be with us next season too.\n\n\"That will include the German Cup final next month and the next Europa League game against Rangers in August.\n\n\"Of course, that\u2019s all dependent on nothing happening before then.\"\n\nChelsea's plan to seal Havertz deal\n\nAccording to a report by the Express, Chelsea are open to looking at a new way to fund their planned move for Havertz this summer.\n\nLampard is desperate to add the talented youngster to his ranks, but as outlined above, a deal will not come cheaply.\n\nWith that in mind, though, it is claimed that the Blues will look to the idea of possibly selling six players to fund a deal for the versatile attacker.\n\nIt is claimed that Chelsea will aim to offload Marcos Alonso, Emerson Palmieri, Michy Batshuayi, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Kenedy and Danny Drinkwater in an attempt to fund a deal.\n\n(Image: ADRIAN DENNIS\/POOL\/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nNo bid yet, but Havertz aware of interest\n\nAccording to German outlet Bild, Chelsea have not made an offer to Bayer Leverkusen but Kai Havertz's representatives are aware of the Blues' interest.\n\nMeanwhile, the Guardian claim that Havertz does not want to wait another year before moving.\n\nAnd that the midfielder finds a move to London 'appealing'.\n\nHavertz asks Leverkusen to sell\n\nAccording to a new report from Bild, Kai Havertz has asked Bayer Leverkusen for his release this summer.\n\nChelsea are thought to be one of two clubs actively trying to sign the youngster, with the other Real Madrid.\n\nThe Blues are prepared to pay Leverkusen\u2019s \u20ac100m asking price for Kai Havertz, but will negotiate breaking it up into instalments.\n\nTwo Chelsea players key\n\nHavertz German international teammates Antonio Rudiger and Timo Werner are two key reasons for Havertz interest in joining Chelsea this summer, according to the Telegraph.\n\nWerner completed a transfer earlier in the summer, with Chelsea looking to make Havertz their third new arrival.\n\nHowever, the report claims that the biggest stumbling block for Chelsea will be the fee, with Leverkusen asking for a price in the region of \u00a390 million.\n\nHavertz keen on Chelsea switch\n\nMidfield star Havertz has told his representatives that he \"would like\" to seal a switch to Stamford Bridge in the summer transfer window, according to Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano.\n\n(Image: Alexander Hassenstein\/Getty Images)\n\nThe Germany international has previously outlined his willingness to play in the Premier League and he is now keen on making that dream come true by sealing a move to Stamford Bridge.\n\nRomano also claims that Havertz's representatives that he wants to leave Leverkusen if a \"important bid\" arrives within the next week.\n\nIt is also reported that Werner could play a bid role in influencing his international teammate's decision.\n\nRudiger contacts Havertz\n\nAccording to Bild, Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger has been in contact with Havertz for a couple of weeks and is trying to convince his international teammate to join the Blues.\n\nRudiger has previously admitted that he would like to see Havertz at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe German midfielder is being heavily linked with a move to Chelsea this summer but it's said he could cost around \u00a3100million.\n\nChelsea ready to meet release clause\n\nChelsea are the only club that are willing to meet the \u00a390million release clause in Havertz's Leverkusen contract, according to a report by the Mail.\n\nIt is believed that Chelsea are locked in a battle with Real Madrid and Bayern Munich to secure the signature for the highly-rated 21-year-old.\n\nMadrid are keen on taking Havertz to the Spanish capital but are not prepared to pay the fee that would be enough to complete a deal, whereas Chelsea are, which puts them at the very front of the queue to complete a deal.\n\nLampard issues update on Havertz links\n\nHead coach Lampard addressed the media on Friday lunchtime ahead of the Blues' trip to Sheffield United and he was asked what the latest developments were concerning the Blues' quest to sign Havertz.\n\nLampard, as you would expect, refused to be drawn on interest linking the Germany international with a move to Stamford Bridge.\n\nLampard explained: \"Unfortunately it's another answer from me that that is not something I want to broach at this moment in time.\n\n\"My focus is completely on the game. So I don't want to give you any ifs buts or maybes for the summer, my focus has to be on the here and now.\"\n\nHudson-Odoi fears\n\nAccording to 90Min.com the one big reason for Chelsea's Havertz interest is because of fears of Callum Hudson-Odoi's progress.\n\nThe teenager has been unlucky with injuries at Stamford Bridge this season, which have stunted his development.\n\nBayern Munich have previously shown an interest in the Chelsea star, but Blues officials are concerned that the injury may prove too much for him to come back from.\n\nChampions League twist\n\nHavertz has openly admitted he wants to play in the Champions League in the past.\n\nAnd Chelsea's defeat to Sheffield United could throw a real spanner in the works over trying to complete a deal this summer.\n\nThe Blues are third in the Premier League, but with a game in hand, both Manchester United and Leicester City can leapfrog them to drop them out of the top four.\n\nHavertz told Sky Germany earlier this year: \"Of course, there\u2019s a lot of speculation at the moment. That\u2019s normal. Right now, Leverkusen are my main focus and I\u2019m concentrating on them. At the end of the season, we\u2019ll find a solution.\n\n\"Personally, I always want to play in the Champions League. That\u2019s been my goal since my first year here and in general that\u2019s a goal for every Bundesliga player. Regardless, I\u2019m grateful to Leverkusen so I don\u2019t want to mess anything up.\"\n\nLampard to sell trio to land Havertz\n\nChelsea are ready to sell left-back Emerson Palmieri and midfield duo Jorginho and Tiemoue Bakayoko in order to fund a deal for the German international.\n\nAccording to a report by Nicolo Schira, a well-respected sports journalist, via the Express, Chelsea are ready to put in a \u20ac70million offer for Havertz, which can be financed by offloading the trio.\n\nJorginho wants to seal a return to Italy to link up with Maurizio Sarri at Juventus, which could be helpful in determining Chelsea's chances of signing Havertz.\n\nHavertz prepared to seal transfer without Champions League guarantee\n\nAccording to a report by BBC Sport, Leverkusen star Havertz would be happy to seal a move to Chelsea without the Blues offering him the guarantee of Champions League football next season.\n\nIn recent weeks, reports have claimed that a move to Stamford Bridge for the Germany international would all hinge on whether or not Chelsea had secured themselves Champions League qualification for 2020\/21.\n\nHowever, it is reported that Chelsea would not see their plans to sign Havertz scuppered if they fail to finish inside the top-four in the Premier League this season.\n\nHavertz, of course, would prefer to join a club that could offer him Champions League football, but it would not be a deal-breaker if he couldn't.\n\nNorwich win serves as boost\n\nChelsea's 1-0 win over Norwich could serve as a massive boost for the Blues' hopes of landing Havertz this summer.\n\nThe three points put the Blues in the driving seat in the race for the final two Champions League spots ahead of the final three games of the season.\n\nChelsea are now four points above both Leicester and Manchester United ahead of the duo's games later this week.\n\nearning Champions League football would make the Havertz move a lot easier to do both financially and in terms of convincing the player.\n\nChelsea's agent advantage\n\nChelsea are once again using the services of lawyer Michael Becker, the men who helped seal the transfer of Timo Werner, in order to get the Havertz deal over the line.\n\nAccording to German football expert Christian Falk, the former agent of Michael Ballack is involved in the deal, which could serve as an advantage for Chelsea.\n\n\"When Werner was coming to England the agent of Ballack, who also helped Ballack move to Chelsea, had his finger in the deal,\" Falk told the Football Ranks podcast.\n\n\"He has work in the [Havertz] deal and if you have such connections to Germany and many people are sitting around the table...\n\n\"I think some people in the background can push the deal a little bit more.\"\n\nLeverkusen transfer terms\n\nLeverkusen will be willing to accept payment for Havertz in instalments.\n\nThat is according to BIld reporter Christian Falk who has issued an update on the big-money transfer.\n\nFalk has confirmed that Leverkusen are unwilling to budge on their valuation of Havertz, with Chelsea having to pay out around \u00a390million to sign the superstar frontman.\n\nHowever, in his update, Falk also admitted that Leverkusen are \"open to having add ons\/bonuses in a deal\" which would suggest Chelsea could get away with paying a lesser fee up front.\n\nHazard clause could help fund Havertz deal\n\nEden Hazard could help his former club seal a deal for Kai Havertz.\n\nThis is because Chelsea are in line to receive a welcome windfall after Real Madrid clinched a 34th La Liga title on Thursday night with a 2-1 win over Villarreal.\n\nReports claim the fee could be as much as \u00a318m, which would go a long way to funding a summer transfer for Havertz who will reportedly cost in the region of \u00a390m.\n\nMarina Granovskaia's deals could fund transfer\n\nBayer Leverkusen's Kai Havertz continues to be linked with a summer switch to Stamford Bridge\n\nThe potential arrival of the Germany international won't come cheap and Chelsea will have to help finance moves by cashing in on some of the players already in west London.\n\nWhile a couple of Lampard's current first-team squad such as Michy Batshuayi and Emerson Palmieri could be on the move over the coming months, here we take a look at some forgotten players who the Blues need to part with.\n\nLampard responds\n\nChelsea head coach Frank Lampard has responded to the links to Havertz, refusing to rule out making more additions during the summer transfer window.\n\nThe Blues have already added Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner to their squad, but the Chelsea boss has not ruled out spending more money this summer.\n\nWe'll see, I can't answer that one we're not there yet,\" Lampard said.\n\n\"We have to focus on what's in front of us.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to compare it to any other spending summer or not.\n\n\"We'll see how I feel and we feel as a club.\n\n\"If the squad needs strengthening or the balancing needs changing, if it does and we make moves great, but at the moment we don't know.\"\n\nHavertz wants to seal transfer\n\nAccording to the Express, Havertz is \"interested\" in finalising a move to Chelsea this summer.\n\nThe German, of course, has been heavily linked with a switch to Stamford Bridge in recent weeks and now wants to make the move happen, despite apparent interest from Real Madrid.\n\nAppearing on talkChelsea, Bleacher Report\u2019s transfer reporter Dean Jones highlighted how keen Havertz is to seal a move to Stamford Bridge.\n\nHe said: \"He is interested, very interested actually.\n\n\"He really wants to push himself and Leverkusen are pretty surprised at how focused he is on finding a new club.\n\n\"He definitely wants Champions League football though so we will have to wait on that situation to be decided before knowing much more.\n\n\"If he joins then I\u2019m not sure what the future holds for Hudson-Odoi at Chelsea.\"\n\nBlues close to completing deal\n\nChelsea are close to completing the signing of Leverkusen midfield sensation Havertz, a report by The Athletic claims.\n\nThe Blues have been plugging away for several weeks in their attempts to sign the Germany international but it now appears as though they will get their man.\n\nIt is claimed that the Blues, following Leverkusen's defeat to Bayern Munich in the recent DFB Cup final, have sped up the process in an attempt to get the deal done.\n\nThe Athletic report that Chelsea will pay Leverkusen around \u20ac80million after add-ons, with the initial fee likely to be either \u20ac65million or \u20ac70million.\n\nChelsea open talks with Leverkusen\n\nAfter weeks and months of speculation, Chelsea have finally officially opened talks with Leverkusen about the prospect of signing Havertz this summer.\n\nAccording to Sky Sports, the Blues have opened talks with the Bundesliga club about concluding a \u00a370million deal, with Chelsea now the only club in the run in for the Germany international.\n\nIt is claimed that former Blues goalkeeper Petr Cech, in his role as the club's technical adviser, will fly to Germany next week to hold face-to-face talks with the club and Havertz.\n\nAbramovich priorities deal\n\nBlues owner Roman Abramovich has made Havertz the club's No.1 transfer target for this forthcoming summer, a report by German publication BILD claims.\n\nThe Russian businessman says Havertz is an 'absolute top priority' and has ordered transfer guru Marina Granovskaia to pull out all the stops in an attempt to complete the deal.\n\nGranovskaia will lead the negotiations in the hope that Havertz can become the Blues' third summer signing behind Ziyech and Werner.\n\nHavertz's ultimatum\n\nAccording to BILD, Kai Havertz is set to demand that Bayer Leverkusen sell him to Chelsea when training starts again on Thursday.\n\nHavertz is reportedly keen to meet with club officials to ask that they sanction his move and accept the Blues' bid.\n\nChelsea are already in talks with the German club, but an agreement has not yet been reached.\n\nSane 'confirms' Havertz transfer\n\nNew Bayern Munich recruit Leroy Sane appears to have confirmed Havertz's impending transfer to Chelsea.\n\nThe Germany international was speaking to the media on Thursday afternoon and was asked to comment on the links linking the Blues with a swoop for his international teammate.\n\nInstead of refusing to comment on the claims, Sane went one further and practically confirmed the Blues' signing of the Leverkusen star.\n\nSane said: \"Werner and Havertz are two amazing signings for Chelsea.\"\n\nMarina decided on next signing\n\nAccording to ESPN, Chelsea boss Lampard has lost patience with first choice goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and once the Havertz is completed, the Blues will turn their attention to signing a new number one.\n\nManchester United's Dean Henderson has been linked, with the Blues reportedly ready to double the England under-21 international's wages in order to lure him from Old Trafford.\n\nThe 23-year-old goalkeeper has enjoyed a highly successful two years on loan at Sheffield United, playing a key part in their promotion to the Premier League - and this season, their surprise challenge for European places.\n\nContract 'agreed'\n\nAccording to Nicolo Schira, via the Express, Chelsea and Leverkusen are working to finalise a deal for Havertz and they only need to reach an agreement over the price.\n\nThe midfielder has reportedly agreed personal terms with Chelsea and will pen a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge worth \u00a37.3million-a-year plus add-ons.\n\nMarina Granovskaia is said to have struck the agreement meaning only the transfer fee needs to be sorted for the move to go through.\n\nBayer Leverkusen set to agree fee\n\nTransfer expert Mark Behrenbeck, via SportWitness, believes Chelsea are set to increase their bid for Havertz to \u20ac80 million plus bonuses with transfer negotiations set to take place next week.\n\nOther suitors appear to now be out of the race and it is suggested that the Bundesliga side will agree to the fee after a fee of a \u20ac100m had been named as the initial asking price.\n\nChelsea's bid is around \u20ac10 million higher than their last.\n\nWhat Marina Granovskaia has been doing to influence Havertz deal\n\nShould Chelsea's aspirations about signing Havertz this summer go according to plan, it will, no doubt, be transfer guru Granovskaia who they have to thank.\n\nThe Chelsea director is at the heart of every deal Chelsea do and she is pulling out of all of the stops to ensure Havertz follows Ziyech and Werner in arriving at Stamford Bridge ahead of next season.\n\n(Image: Photo by Chelsea Football Club\/Chelsea FC via Getty Images)\n\nNow, according to a report Bild, via the Express, Granovskaia has been in regular dialogue with Leverkusen in recent weeks about how the Blues could possibly cut the price of any potential deal.\n\nAccording to the report, Granovskaia has been frequently talking to Leverkusen, attempting to lower the price of a deal to sign the midfielder.\n\nHowever, it is claimed that Leverkusen are not willing to budge on their \u00a390million asking price.\n\nMarina Granovskaia speeding up negotiations after Chelsea seal Champions League spot\n\nAfter nailing down a Champions League place once and for all for next season, Chelsea are now rushing to conclude a deal for Havertz, according to a report by the Daily Mail.\n\nWith a top-four finish now secured, which will offer hope that the Blues will soon conclude a deal for the 21-year-old midfielder, Granovskaia is looking to get negotiations wrapped up as soon as possible and get a deal over the line.\n\nChelsea move closer\n\nfootball.london understands Chelsea are closing in on the signing of Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen following talks between the clubs.\n\nThe only significant remaining obstacle the Bundesliga side's asking price.\n\nThe 21-year-old Germany international has already signalled his desire to move to West London and will likely sign a five-year deal once the clubs can agree a fee.

That is something Chelsea feel is not a fair price for the 21-year-old.\n\n\"However, they are obviously keen to get the player and are willing to pay.\"\n\nHavertz pressuring Leverkusen\n\nMidfield starlet Havertz is putting pressure on Bayer Leverkusen to let him seal a summer move to Chelsea.\n\nThe Blues are continuing to be heavily linked with a move for the Germany international and are believed to be well down the line with their negotiations with Leverkusen.\n\nThe sticking point, though, remains the transfer fee itself, with Leverkusen, understandably, holding out for as big a fee as possible.\n\nNevertheless, Havertz wants to seal a move to Stamford Bridge as soon as possible and is now continuously pushing Leverkusen to wrap up the deal, a report by the Express claims.\n\nMarina Granovskaia's latest transfer trick\n\nChelsea are ready to reduce their \u00a336million asking price for midfielder Jorginho this summer in order to recoup funds as quickly as possible to be able to fund a deal for Havertz, a report by calciomercato claims.\n\nJorginho is poised to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the midfielder not believed to be part of Lampard's long-term plans.\n\nJuventus are long-term admirers of the midfielder and are keen to take him back to Italy.\n\nAnd now, it seems, Juventus may get the chance to do that in a cut-price deal, with Chelsea ready to let him go for less than \u00a336million in a plan to get funds in their budget as quickly as possible so that they can get the Havertz deal over the line.\n\nBayern Munich make Havertz decision\n\nGerman giants Bayern Munich have officially ruled themselves out of the race for Havertz this summer.\n\nThe Bundesliga side, like Chelsea, have been keeping a close eye on the Germany international but have now officially ended their interest.\n\nBayern boss Hanzi Flick has confirmed that Bayern will not be signing him this summer, meaning Chelsea are now free to try and get the deal over the line.\n\nFlick told Sport 1: \u201cHavertz not going to Bayern.\"\n\nLeverkusen send strong message to Chelsea\n\nBayer Leverkusen chief Rudi Voller has sent a message to Chelsea over their interest in Havertz.\n\nThe Leverkusen director has also confirmed the Blues' interest in the midfielder, but has made the conditions of any potential transfer clear.\n\n(Image: MARTIN MEISSNER\/POOL\/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIn an interview with Gazetta dello Sport, Voller said: \"He's the best I've seen here in Leverkusen and I've been here for ages. We had Emerson, Ballack, Z\u00e9 Roberto, Kroos, but he surpasses them.\n\n\"We know that some teams are interested, especially Chelsea. But for us it's pretty easy. He still has a two-year contract. If someone accepts our conditions, that's okay, otherwise they'll stay for another year and we'll be happy. It won't be easy, but there is no Covid discount for such an artist.\"\n\nHavertz 'agrees' five-year deal\n\nA report by RMC Sport, via the Mail, claims that Havertz has agreed to sign a five-year deal at Stamford Bridge as soon as Chelsea and Leverkusen reach an agreement over a deal.\n\nHavertz is eager to swap the Bundesliga for the Premier League this summer and has now given Chelsea his word that he will do just that as soon as the two clubs can agree on a transfer fee.\n\nAnd even though Leverkusen are unwilling to budge on their \u00a390million valuation, Chelsea remain confident that they can land the Germany international's signature this summer.\n\nBosz jokes about Havertz's future\n\nPeter Bosz - the Bayer Leverkusen head coach - joked about Havertz's future in his post-match press conference following the Bundesliga side's 2-1 defeat to Inter Milan in their Europa League quarter-final on Monday evening.\n\nHaving fallen 2-0 behind inside the opening 21 minutes, Leverkusen gave themselves a fighting chance of getting back into the game through Havertz on 24 minutes. It was not enough though to avoid exiting the competition.\n\nAfter the game, Bosz, as expected, was quizzed on the German's future and he joked about where the midfielder would be sealing a transfer to this summer.\n\nBosz said: \"Yes, I can exclusively announce he'll play for [Dutch outfit] Heracles Almelo!\"\n\nClearly there was a sense of humour in Bosz's answer, as, with respect, Heracles Almelo would not be able to fund a transfer fee that a deal to sign Havertz required.\n\nHavertz deal edges closer\n\nFollowing Leverkusen's exit from the Europa League, Chelsea will now be hoping that their negotiations with the German club will increase in speed.\n\nThat is according to the Evening Standard.\n\nThey claim that Leverkusen's Europa League exit will speed up the process of the transfer, with Havertz desperate to complete the move. He has agreed personal terms and all that is left to be decided on is the transfer fee itself.\n\nChelsea delay left-back signing to seal Kai Havertz deal\n\nAccording to Sky Italy and Guardian journalist Fabrizio Romano, Chelsea have put talks to sign Ben Chilwell and Sergio Reguilon on the backburner.\n\nThe Blues are reportedly keen to prioritise the signing of Havertz before moving onto other targets.\n\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard has reportedly instructed the club to land a new left-back this summer, but the Blues head coach may have to wait a little longer.\n\nLeverkusen chief's statement\n\nLeverkusen chief Rudi Voller reiterated the German club's stance on any Havertz transfer to Chelsea.\n\nVoller already said that the Blues would not be getting any \"coronavirus discount\" on Havertz and that they would be standing firm on their \u00a390million valuation.\n\nAnd, speaking to Kicker, he reaffirmed that stance..\n\nHe said: \"I like to repeat myself when I emphasise that we are talking about a wonderful footballer.\n\n\"There is no new status in this personnel. It is clear and amicable with him and his advisors that he can only switch on certain terms. Otherwise, he will stay.\"\n\nLeverkusen chief make huge admission\n\nBayer Leverkusen CEO Fernando Carro has admitted for the first time that Kai Havertz desire is to leave the club this summer.\n\nThe Blues are pushing hard to complete a deal for the German international, and have been handed a big boost with Leverkusen's exit from the Europa League this week.\n\nFrank Lampard's hopes of completing a deal have now taken another boost with the comments from Carro.\n\n\u201cIt was always clear that there would be talks as soon as the Europa League ended for us. Kai has expressed a wish to take the next step. Whether this will work in the near future or not, I can\u2019t say at the moment,\" he told Kolner Stadt-Anzeiger.\n\nDespite the admission, Leverkusen are still said to be asking for a fee of around \u00a390 million for the midfielder.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHavertz warning\n\nChelsea have been handed a warning over the signing of Havertz this summer.\n\nLukas Podolski made the move from Germany to the Premier League, playing for Arsenal, and he is not convinced Havertz is cut out for the Premier League.\n\nSpeaking to the Athletic, he said: \"He\u2019s a great talent. On the ball he is so creative, but he\u2019s still young \u2014 let\u2019s see if he can fit into the Premier League.\n\n\"I think he is still missing some strength and power, but he should taste the drink of the Premier League and see if he likes it.\"\n\nChelsea negotiating structure of deal\n\nAccording to Sky Sports, Chelsea are still negotiating how to structure the payments for Havertz.\n\nThe report claims that Bayer Leverkusen are still sticking to their \u00a390million valuation of the player.\n\nBut the up-front fee to be paid by Chelsea isn't the issue, but rather the total amount with add-ons the sticking point.\n\nChelsea in 'final stages' to complete transfer\n\nChelsea are very close to sealing a deal for Havertz this summer, according to a report by The Express.\n\nIt is claimed that the Blues are in the 'final stages' of negotiations with Leverkusen as they look to get a deal over the line.\n\nThough a deal is edging closer, a structure of payments is yet to be decided.\n\nLeverkusen give deadline\n\nBayer Leverkusen are becoming impatient and have therefore set a deadline for Chelsea to complete a deal for Havertz, according to reports in Germany.\n\nBild report that the Blues risk missing out on a deal for the midfielder should they not reach an agreement with Leverkusen by August 28th.\n\nThat means that Chelsea have just over a week to conclude a deal for Havertz.\n\n\u00a318m difference\n\nBoth Chelsea and Leverkusen are locked in talks over Havertz, but there still remains a difference in valuation, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\nIt is claimed that with personal terms agreed between Havertz and Chelsea, the final hurdle in a deal is the fee.\n\nHowever, the two clubs are still said to be a difference of \u00a318 million between Chelsa's first bid and Bayer Leverkusen's price tag.\n\nLeverkusen line up replacement\n\nAlthough the two clubs still remain apart on their valuation, it seems that Leverkusen may be preparing for life without Havertz next season.\n\nAccording to Sky Sports Italia's Angelo Mangiante, the Bundesliga club are targeting Roma's Patrik Schick as a potential replacement for the midfielder.\n\nRoma are said to value Schick, who spent last season on loan at RB Leipzig, at around \u00a322.5million.\n\nChelsea ready to open fresh talks\n\nChelsea are ready to open fresh talks with Leverkusen about the prospect of speeding up a deal for Havertz this summer.\n\nThat is according to Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano, via the Express.\n\nIt is reported that the Blues are ready to begin a fresh round of talks with the Bundesliga outfit, with Havertz waiting for an agreement between the two clubs to be reached.\n\nHe wants to seal a move to Stamford Bridge and ideally wants the move wrapped up as soon as possible.\n\nLeverkusen could accept deal today\n\nBayer Leverkusen could accept an offer from Chelsea for Havertz as early as today, a report by the Express claims.\n\nAs outlined above, the Blues are desperate to land the midfielder this summer and are confident of getting a deal over the line.\n\nAnd now it has emerged that a deal could be close to getting over the line.\n\nIt is reported that Leverkusen want \u20ac95million for Havertz, but Chelsea are only willing to pay \u20ac86million.

He is currently away with the Germany squad ahead of their UEFA Nations League double-header with Spain and Switzerland.\n\nAnnouncement soon\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Chelsea could officially unveil Havertz as a Blues player within the next 24 hours.\n\nChelsea are ready to pay the fee required to get the deal over the line, with the personal terms between the Blues and Havertz all but sealed.\n\nThe midfielder is keen to work under Lampard after conversations with him and is now poised to undergo a medical.\n\nMidfielder leaves Germany squad\n\nDespite being in the middle of international duty with Germany, Havertz has left the Germans' camp in Stuttgart and is now on his way to Chelsea.\n\nThat is according to German media outlet Sport Bild, who report that he has left the squad ahead of undergoing a medical."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sport\/formula1\/53654385","domain":"bbc.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-04 15:41:00","title":"Formula 1: Pirelli say tyres failures caused by 'extremely long use' on demanding track","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/ace\/standard\/624\/cpsprodpb\/4768\/production\/_113808281_hamilton_getty.jpg","content":"Pirelli F1 boss Mario Isola said he believed the right-rear tyre failure that triggered Daniil Kvyat's Alpha Tauri to crash on lap 12 was \"probably caused by a slow puncture\", but he said that the tyre had been sent back the company's base in Milan for further investigation.

I had a good start in the first race, and the pace all season, every single race, the pace has been there. Qualifying has been super close every single time with Lewis, sometimes he beats me, sometimes I beat him. It's small margins.\n\n\"So I don't know the reason for now. There were couple of shitty races for me in Silverstone, with bad luck. At this point it's difficult to say. Maybe when time goes on I can say, for now I've no answer.\n\n\"Apart from the first race, it's been pretty bad. There's not been a weekend that has gone smoothly and without issue, apart from the first one, so a pretty bad season so far. Obviously, that's disappointing.\n\n\"So yes, nice to have a break. Hopefully, we still have many more races to go, maybe even up to 10 or something like this. I would hope so. So far, far from ideal.\"\n\nBottas said he's had no issues with the relentless pace of the season, which has seen six races squeezed into seven weekends.\n\n\"It's been okay, honestly, you know, we all had quite a long time off from F1, so we were really kind of ready and committed to go for it.\n\n\"Sometimes you might want to spend more time with many people that you're not allowed and can't, you take it because the only goal is to win the title, and I do everything for that.\n\n\"In theory, there's always possibilities, that helps, but like today is a big frustration because, obviously, the last two weekends I lost a lot of points compared to Lewis and this was kind of again, for me mentally would have been important to get more points than Lewis and Max.\n\n\"But didn't happen so then it's tough. As I said before, no doubt.

Some items might have been pitched into the courtyard at the athletes\u2019 village.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was indignation and there were denials \u2014 several U.S. players insisted the furniture was of inferior quality in explaining how it became kindling. Ultimately, a check was written and the incident became a footnote to the NHL\u2019s long and for the most part memorable participation in the Olympics.\n\nBut it was an incident that no doubt came up at least peripherally as the NHL and the league\u2019s players\u2019 association put the finishing touches on their ambitious plan to return to play after the season was paused on March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBecause no matter how much work went into building the two bubble environments in Toronto and Edmonton \u2014 there had to be significant care taken to ensure all that work wasn\u2019t put asunder by those exiting the bubble.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, only one team, the New York Rangers, had been eliminated. But by Sunday, all eight best-of-five qualifying rounds will be completed and eight teams will be heading home.\n\nAnd while most people might have given little thought to how teams depart the bubbles, multiple sources familiar with the protocols indicate the architects of the return to play have taken great care to keep the bubble intact even as the first players, coaches and staff depart.\n\nThat\u2019s because members of a team that\u2019s been eliminated has the power to bring the entire bubble crashing down. Or at the very least, a few rogue players looking to vent their frustrations by going over the wall in downtown Toronto and Edmonton could test the very limits of the bubbles that league sources and those connected to teams in the bubbles say have been treated with the utmost respect to this point.\n\nTo ensure the sanctity of those bubbles, extra security is added around those teams that are eliminated to ensure that there are no issues, one source familiar with the protocols said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t predict what one team or another will do,\u201d the source said.\n\nSo better safe than sorry. For the record, reports from the Toronto hub indicated that the Rangers were the model of decorum after they were swept by the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\n\u201cThe teams have been completely compliant,\u201d one source said of the process of preparing to exit the bubbles. \u201cManagement wants to get them out of there as well. They have complete respect for what\u2019s going on here. \u2026 I don\u2019t think a team wants to be \u2018the one\u2019 that messes with the bubble.\u201d\n\nThe NHL wants teams to leave all areas, including accommodations, in the Edmonton and Toronto bubbles as soon as possible after squads are eliminated. (Andy Devlin \/ NHLI via Getty Images)\n\nAs for the notion that eliminated teams might be thinking about themselves more than the bigger picture, one team official shared the belief that players understand what has gone into making this event come together. Partying on Whyte Avenue in Edmonton or in downtown Toronto after being eliminated might be attractive, but this source was skeptical people would act on those desires.\n\n\u201cI think the amount of work that\u2019s gone into this is respected by the players and the staff and the coaches and everybody,\u201d this source said. \u201cNo one wants to jeopardize that.\u201d\n\nTeams have been treated so well, he added, \u201cand they want to pay that back with respect.\u201d\n\nMathieu Schneider, a longtime NHLPA executive member and a key figure in the return to play discussions over the past five months is in the bubble in Edmonton. He doesn\u2019t anticipate any issues with players acting out and endangering the bubble and that like most teams at the end of a playoff series they will be focused on getting home to their families.\n\n\u201cI think players understand what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cThese guys are professionals and they know what\u2019s at stake for the entire tournament, the game, the NHL and so far everyone\u2019s taking a lot of pride in that.\u201d\n\nPlus, the longtime NHLer noted, it would be hard for team members to actually get out of the bubble in Edmonton and then back in undetected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn all honesty it would be extremely difficult for someone to leave our situation,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to have a pretty well-coordinated effort to get outside from where we are here. \u2026 Not saying it couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nBut it seems unlikely.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the potential for post-elimination folks defying the rules. There are a host of other elements to getting teams out of the bubble.\n\nFor anyone who has followed the planning that went into getting 24 teams safely into two cities and create an environment in which they could live and play for weeks on end, it won\u2019t come as any surprise that the details surrounding getting rid of the eliminated teams is also layered and rich in details.\n\nInitially, teams wanted a 36-hour window to vacate the bubbles after elimination. This made sense on some levels.\n\nBecause teams will scatter from Edmonton and Toronto to a host of offseason locales and since teams won\u2019t reconvene until training camp for the 2020-21 season likely in mid-November if the pandemic allows, many end-of-season details have to be attended to in the bubbles.\n\nThere were plans for exit meetings to be held in the bubble cities.\n\nBut league organizers started looking at that window after competition and the potential for players or any team staff, for that matter, no longer in the hunt for the Cup to blow off steam and consider breaching the bubble. They then revised that plan.\n\nWith the blessing of deputy commissioner Bill Daly and the NHLPA, that window was dramatically reduced to, in some cases, a matter of hours.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to get teams out of here as soon as possible,\u201d one source said.\n\nThe process of preparing teams begins immediately after a team finds itself in an elimination situation.\n\nFor instance, when Winnipeg dropped Game 3 of its qualifying round series against Calgary on Tuesday afternoon, league officials set up a meeting with team officials well in advance of their Thursday evening game against the Flames to explain the protocols, should they be eliminated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is the same for all teams that lose their second game in any of the qualifying round series and will be the case once a team loses a third game in the upcoming best-of-seven playoff series.\n\nDepending on when teams play \u2014 i.e. the early games on any particular day \u2014 they may be asked to plan to pack up their belongings and exit the bubble as early as the evening of their final loss, depending on the circumstances for that particular team.\n\nIf teams play later, like the Rangers, who played Game 3 against Carolina at 8 p.m. ET on Tuesday, they would work up a plan to leave as early as possible the next day.\n\nOne team official noted that there are certain elements to planning an exit from the bubble that are different than a normal playoff road trip. There are treatment rooms and coaches\u2019 room and video rooms that have been established for most if not all teams in the bubbles and so dismantling those requires extra time.\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t lose a game and get on a bus and drive to the airport,\u201d the team source said. \u201cA lot of things have to be broken down.\u201d\n\nAnd the reality is that every team has different needs and circumstances.\n\nCalgary could have a short trip south from Edmonton to get home.\n\nWinnipeg is going to make a short flight to Manitoba if they are eliminated.\n\nEdmonton, which has a number of younger players, may be playing in their home city but they may not have actual housing pending their lease agreements and so the league will help with some of those details. Canadian teams will have different issues since they won\u2019t be crossing any borders to return to their home cities.\n\nFor players on American-based teams that want to remain in Canada after the tournament, they will have to follow quarantine rules including self-isolating for 14 days, which is required by the Canadian government. Since the bubbles are considered to have been a quarantine site, players and staff not traveling with their teams to the U.S. would have to self-quarantine until at least Sunday (the 14-day mark after all teams arrived in the bubbles) and the league would inform health officials of plans for those people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor players who request a physical before checking out of the bubble, the league will help teams assign medical officials to perform those medicals prior to departure. Team exit meetings will be done remotely at a later date.\n\nThe league will help coordinate buses to the airport for team charters in Toronto and Edmonton. They also help coordinate clean-up of the team spaces in the bubble after their departure.\n\nSchneider said he\u2019s not na\u00efve enough to suggest that organizers thought of everything in coming up with the rules of life in the two bubbles, but given the collective experience of those involved in coming up with the plan they did cover a lot of ground including on just how best to make the exit as seamless as the entrance.\n\nAnd since we started with a reference to the \u201998 U.S. team it\u2019s worth noting that Schneider was a member of that group.

In that respect, we have to learn how to tune the car to help the tyres survive a little bit.\n\n\"I'm really curious to see and interested to see how we're going to do in Barcelona. We have a handful of days to understand, and there is nothing better than a great challenge.\n\n\"We embrace the challenge, we love the fight, and they're a strong competitor and Max is a very good driver.\n\n\"If you consider they had a full DNF at the beginning of the season, that gap is not large. It would only be five points behind and not 30.\n\n\"There are maybe 10 more races to go. DNFs can quickly make the points swing, and yeah, it could be much more interesting than many people were afraid of two weeks ago.\"\n\nRed Bull boss Christian Horner said he's waiting for a \"clearer picture\" to emerge before making a call on Verstappen's prospects.\n\nIn the past the Milton Keynes team has traditionally become more competitive as the season has gone on, although the change in the schedule due to COVID-19 means that some of the circuits where it has excelled are not being used.\n\n\"It's difficult to say,\" said Horner when asked by Autosport if Verstappen can gain title momentum.\n\n\"I think Mercedes underperformed today, compared to the last few events, so I think it's going to be a few more races yet before we have a clearer picture on that. But we're delighted to get this first victory of 2020, particularly on this anniversary race.\"\n\nPLUS: Why inflation left Mercedes poorer at Silverstone\n\nHorner added that the second Silverstone event was the first true sign of the potential of the RB16.\n\n\"These cars put up a little bit of a fight so far,\" he said. \"It has only been today that we have really seen the performance that we believe that it is capable of.\n\n\"So for us it is very important that we understand why it has performed so well today, in corners that we were weak in on Saturday today was no issue at all.\n\n\"The wind was a little bit less, temperatures were pretty similar to the last couple of days, and last weekend. Tyre pressures were slightly different, because of the problems Pirelli had last weekend.\n\n\"It is important for us to take away this data and analyse it and understand it, because we're definitely underperforming on Saturdays, where we are fighting over tenths with Racing Point and Renaults this weekend, and then we were lapping them in the race.\n\n\"So there is a big delta, and we've seen a bit of a pattern of that across the last four or five races. We've got a lot to understand, but it is really encouraging to have this performance.

Certainly nobody anticipated football shutting down completely the following week, as nervousness turned to indignation about Atletico fans travelling to Anfield, before matches behind closed doors became matches postponed indefinitely.\n\nAnd yet when football returned in June, Atletico were transformed. They went unbeaten in the 11 games after the resumption, to dispel concerns they could miss out on La Liga\u2019s four. They won seven matches and drew four, one of them against Barcelona at Camp Nou, which helped Real Madrid clinch the title. They scored 20 goals and conceded six. If the season had started when the league restarted, Atletico would have finished second. \u201cWe did well and we know we\u2019re on a really good streak but the Champions League is a different competition,\u201d said Diego Costa last week.\n\nAtletico face Leipzig in Lisbon today as one of the form teams still standing, in a tournament that has gifted them the significantly kinder half of the draw. If they beat Leipzig, who laboured to a third-place finish in the Bundesliga, they will face either Atalanta, the tournament\u2019s minnows or Paris Saint-Germain, who have played two games in almost half a year.\n\nMeanwhile, in the other half, only one of Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester City and Lyon can reach the final. Without doubt, Atletico\u2019s opponents and potential semi-final opponents will be just as eager to capitalise, especially PSG, whose longing for success in the Champions League has come to define them.\n\nAnd it is unknown how Simeone\u2019s squad will be affected by the club\u2019s announcement on Sunday that Angel Correa and Sime Vrsaljko tested positive for coronavirus, with both players, who would likely have been on the bench, left at home.\n\nA required second round of tests on Sunday meant preparations had to be tweaked, including delaying the squad\u2019s flight to Lisbon from Monday until Tuesday afternoon. But it is hard to shake the sense that as a team, Atletico are very well-placed, even if the club have always appeared more comfortable as under-dogs under Simeone than burdened by expectation.\n\nEven the new format could suit them, in single matches where game management is likely to be key and technical superiority has less time to win out than over the traditional 180 minutes. A riled Jurgen Klopp said after Liverpool\u2019s 1-0 defeat at the Wanda Metropolitano in February that Atletico\u2019s backs-to-the-wall approach would not be as effective without their own fans.\n\nYet they were able to frustrate Liverpool at Anfield too, before winning 3-2 in the second leg. \u201cIt\u2019s important to accept the new format because once you accept it, you can adapt,\u201d said Atleti\u2019s Saul Niguez.\n\nLeipzig, meanwhile, were still in the title race in March and considered a threat even in the Champions League, on the back of destroying Jose Mourinho\u2019s Tottenham in the last 16. But they have been less effective since the restart and will be less potent without Timo Werner, whose move to Chelsea cruelly prevents him from finishing what he started in the Champions League."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.liverpoolecho.co.uk\/sport\/football\/football-news\/frank-lampard-looking-jurgen-klopp-18705029","domain":"liverpoolecho.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-03 07:40:00","title":"Frank Lampard looking to Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool to solve Chelsea problem","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk\/article23482538.ece\/ALTERNATES\/s810\/2_GettyImages-689013540.jpg","content":"Frank Lampard looking to Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool to solve Chelsea problem\n\nChelsea boss Frank Lampard was speaking after his side's defeat to Arsenal in the FA Cup final on Saturday\n\nFrank Lampard looks to Liverpool example to improve Chelsea\n\nFrank Lampard will look to use Liverpool and Manchester City's respective success as his own blueprint for improving Chelsea's defence.\n\nThis follows his side's defeat in the FA Cup final on Saturday.

(Photo by Kevin C. Cox\/Getty Images)\n\nThe Suns have beat the following teams since NBA play began: the Washington Wizards, Dallas Mavericks, Los Angeles Clippers and Indiana Pacers. So, a true Western Conference contender, two legit playoff teams and, well, the Wizards. It can hardly be said the Suns are only undefeated in the bubble because of their record.\n\nThat Clippers win in particular was a cathartic night for one of the NBA\u2019s youngest teams. Star Devin Booker iced the game with a fadeaway buzzer-beater over the outstretched arms of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.\n\nThe first eight days of official play in the bubble have made clear anything (short of a Wizards win) can happen. The Clippers, Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 arguably the top tier of NBA contenders \u2014 are a combined 5-6 against other teams. The Raptors looked like the bubble\u2019s scariest team, then got worked over by Boston. T.J. Warren, whom the Suns dumped for cash just a year ago, scored 53 points in a game.\n\nSo, of course the Suns could walk onto the Disney World campus and reel off four straight wins.\n\nWith those four wins, the Suns have their record up to 30-39 and sit tied for 11th place with the New Orleans Pelicans. They still sit 1.5 games back from the ninth-place Portland Trail Blazers for a shot at a play-in series, and will also need to leapfrog the San Antonio Spurs to get a shot at the postseason.\n\nThe Suns will close their season with games against the Miami Heat, Oklahoma City Thunder, Philadelphia 76ers and Mavericks. Unless those teams rest their stars to stay fresh for the playoffs, none of those games will be easy wins, but the time to rule anything out with this team has clearly passed.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:"},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/theworldgame.sbs.com.au\/muscat-makes-dream-debut-as-sint-truiden-coach","domain":"theworldgame.sbs.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-10 00:49:06","title":"Muscat makes dream debut as Sint-Truiden coach","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.sbs.com.au\/dims4\/default\/b418117\/2147483647\/strip\/true\/crop\/1280x720+0+0\/resize\/1280x720!\/quality\/90\/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsbs-au-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdrupal%2Ftopics%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ftwg_articles%2F20200810001484213005-original.png&imwidth=1280","content":"And goalkeeper Danny Vukovic made it a red letter day for Australian football after making his long-awaited comeback from injury by helping his club Genk to victory.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a baptism of fire for Muscat, who is the only Australian head coach of a men's team in Europe after playing a major part as a player, captain and coach in making Melbourne Victory an A-League powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscat had issues to resolve before obtaining permission from the Belgian authorities to take charge of a professional club.\n\nWhile his application for his coaching licence to be recognised was being processed, he was given the role of technical director of the club they call the 'Canaries' but that did not hinder his preparations for the season.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuscat's pre-season work with the help of Australian assistant Luciano Trani has paid dividends with a vital first-up 2-1 win over fancied Gent that gives him and his players plenty of confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nSint-Truiden face a stiffer challenge in their next match away to Anderlecht next Monday (AEST).\n\nIt also was a day of huge relief for Vukovic who will now forget all the long hours of lonely rehabilitation after a freak training injury that kept him out of the game for a whole season and robbed him of the chance to play in this season's truncated UEFA Champions League.\n\n\n\n\n\nVukovic completed his recovery when he started and starred for Genk in a come-from-behind 2-1 win at Zulte Waregem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel the injury is definitely all behind me now and it was just great to be back,\" Vukovic said after being named man of the match by a supporters' group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was hot out there yet I felt good and sharp despite the tough conditions.

They\u2019ve added youngsters Jamal Musiala, Malik Tillman, and Bright Arrey-Mbi to the squad for the remainder of the competition. Oliver Batista Meier, Joshua Zirkzee, Sarpreet Singh, and Lasse Mai have been left out of the main, 25-man squad. There is, of course, a \u2018B\u2019 list that squads in the competition can have, for which Bayern has placed Zirkzee on. The list is technically reserved for players born on or after January 1st, 1998 and have been eligible to play for the club concerned for any uninterrupted period of two years since his 15th birthday. Zirkzee checks all of those boxes.\n\nEach squad is still currently limited to 25 \u2018A\u2019 list players, thus the need for the \u2018B\u2019 list. For the main group of 25, all of those players must have been previously registered and eligible to play for their club at the domestic level since February 3rd or no later than before the first leg of the round of 16 ties as they were initially scheduled pre-coronavirus.\n\nFor Chelsea, they did not make any changes to their squad, but lost Chrisitan Pulisic, Cesar Azpilicueta and Pedro to injury last weekend in their FA Cup final loss against Arsenal.

On that night, Miocic lost his heavyweight title as Cormier celebrated his achievement of becoming a two-division UFC champion.\n\nThirteen months later, Miocic exacted his revenge with a fourth-round TKO as he became the first person (on record) to finish Cormier as he reclaimed UFC gold. Another year has passed and neither Miocic nor Cormier have fought or faced anyone since their previously encounter.\n\nThat\u2019s an awful lot of time spent focusing on a single opponent \u2026 a fact that\u2019s certainly not lost on Miocic as he stands just days away from his third and hopefully final meeting with Cormier.\n\n\u201cThree years of it I guess,\u201d Miocic said with a laugh when responding to MMA Fighting about how well he knows Cormier at this point. \u201cEvery fight\u2019s different, he\u2019s got a different game plan himself, so do I. We\u2019re working on weaknesses, trying to exploit them on their part.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what I do. It\u2019s part of the game. I\u2019m a competitive person and I love competition. This is it. After this and we\u2019re done with the trilogy. Finally it\u2019s over. The trilogy is over.\u201d\n\nConsidering he\u2019s spent nearly 25 minutes in the cage with Cormier not to mention months upon months of preparation, Miocic and his team have dissected just about every nuance possible heading into the third fight.\n\nWhat started as a friendly contest between acquaintances has quietly turned into a fierce rivalry after splitting a pair of fights. While it\u2019s not likely you\u2019ll hear Miocic or Cormier say a bad word about the other outside of the competition itself, there\u2019s definitely an intensity shared between them that ratchets up the anticipation for this third and final showdown.\n\nRegardless of what\u2019s been said in the past, Miocic makes it clear that he holds Cormier up with the utmost respect, especially when asked to describe what he\u2019s learned about the former two-time Olympian after spending so much time in the octagon together.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great fighter,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cThat guy keeps coming, he doesn\u2019t stop. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s at the top. He\u2019s a hell of a fighter. He\u2019s going to bring it again here on Saturday. I\u2019m ready for it.\u201d\n\nOn the flipside, Miocic was forced to dig deep into his own psyche after falling to Cormier the first time and then mounting an epic comeback to finish him in the rematch.\n\nIn particular, the 37-year-old heavyweight champion had to figure out why he struggled so much in the early going during that second meeting to ensure it doesn\u2019t happen again on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cI felt like, especially with the rematch, I got off to a slow start until the third round when I started moving around,\u201d Miocic stated. \u201cI think that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever started that slow in a fight, but I still finished it. Hopefully I keep it that way. You learn a lot. Just don\u2019t be an idiot and don\u2019t start slow.\n\n\u201cI just do what I do and remember everything we\u2019ve been doing and just fight like every fight. Keep my hands up and everything my coaches have been planning over the past 10 weeks, I think I\u2019ll be fine. I think if I do what I do and go after him, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\nIn the weeks leading up to UFC 252, Cormier has loudly declared his intention to use his wrestling to best Miocic after they both avoiding grappling exchanges for the most part in the previous fights. Some of that could be Cormier playing mind games in an effort to get Miocic looking for the takedown, which might then cause him to miss a left or right hook barreling towards his head.\n\nThen again, Cormier could just be laying out his most effective path to victory as one of the most accomplished wrestlers to ever set foot inside the octagon. Either way, Miocic promises he\u2019s ready for whatever Cormier throws at him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cWe worked on it, we worked on everything, we worked on every aspect of MMA. We worked on standing, we worked on the ground, we worked on wrestling, worked on jiu-jitsu, worked on boxing, kickboxing, we\u2019re doing everything.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be ready for it. If he takes me down, I\u2019ll get right back up.\u201d\n\nIn a perfect world, Miocic would only focus on the fight and his preparation to face Cormier and leave all of the other promotional bluster surrounding this event to the side.\n\nHe\u2019s not thinking about a potential rematch with Francis Ngannou or Cormier\u2019s inevitable retirement after he\u2019s said numerous times that the third fight with Miocic will be the last time he ever competes in mixed martial arts.\n\nIf there\u2019s one subject that does get his attention ahead of Saturday night it\u2019s the overwhelming feeling that the winner of the UFC 252 main event will be declared the greatest heavyweight in history. Miocic may be soft spoken about a lot of things but he\u2019s not afraid to stake his claim to the legacy he\u2019s building in the sport.\n\n\u201cDefinitely. I believe so,\u201d Miocic said when asked if the winner of the trilogy will be considered the best heavyweight of all time. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done so much. Unfortunately for him, it\u2019s going to be me.\u201d\n\nWith so much on the line, Miocic is fully aware that he needs to put a stamp on this rivalry by retaining his title in the most dominant fashion possible. Of course, Cormier has no problem telling him that the first fight ended in a knockout and the rematch appeared to be headed in a similar direction until Miocic mounted his comeback.\n\nThat\u2019s why Miocic would love nothing more than to end this particular chapter with an exclamation point.\n\n\u201cHell yeah, a knockout\u2019s the way to go,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cEnd the night early, come out of there unscathed. Listen, I\u2019m definitely going for a knockout.\n\n\u201cIf it goes five rounds, it goes five rounds, I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019m going to get that win. That\u2019s legit all I care about.\u201d\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, Miocic fully intends to leave the UFC APEX with the heavyweight title around his waist with plans to move forward in his career without ever crossing paths with Cormier as an opponent again.\n\nNo matter the result or the rift that\u2019s grown between them over three fights, Miocic will gladly end Saturday night by shaking Cormier\u2019s hand and wishing him well in retirement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no bad blood towards him. Not at all,\u201d Miocic said. \u201cI\u2019m going out with the belt around my waist but I\u2019ll definitely shake his hand say it was a hell of a time.\u201d"},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.skysports.com\/boxing\/news\/12183\/12047874\/kubrat-pulev-calls-anthony-joshua-arrogant-for-discussing-unification-fight-with-tyson-fury","domain":"skysports.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 16:33:58","title":"Kubrat Pulev calls Anthony Joshua 'arrogant' for discussing unification fight with Tyson Fury","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/e0.365dm.com\/20\/03\/768x432\/skysports-anthony-joshua-kubrat-pulev_4936401.jpg?20200302120224","content":"Anthony Joshua is \"arrogant\" for discussing a unification fight with Tyson Fury before defending his world titles, according to his next opponent Kubrat Pulev.\n\nJoshua could face Fury in an undisputed world title fight in 2021, having agreed terms in principle on a two-fight deal, but the pair will first need to defend their titles against Pulev and Deontay Wilder.\n\nPulev, who is Joshua's IBF mandatory challenger, insists the British boxer is repeating the same mistakes he made before losing to Andy Ruiz Jr last summer - when talk of a super-fight with Wilder dominated the build-up.\n\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Eddie Hearn says Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury's brief conversation on holiday in Marbella could have been 'a bit awkward', but insists they respect each other\n\n\"This is also very arrogant.

A short time later, Freeman and his Braves teammates learned they will spend the remainder of this season without their ace. Soroka tore his right Achilles tendon in the third inning of a 7-2 loss to the Mets at Truist Park on Monday. His absence damages the World Series hopes of the Braves, who now have a gaping void within a rotation that already had a few holes. \u201cTo sum it up, this night just sucks,\u201d Freeman said. Quite frankly, there wasn\u2019t any way to sugarcoat what happened. The hope is Soroka will return to form and continue to be one of the game\u2019s top pitchers next year. But his presence will be severely missed by a team that is bidding for a third straight National League East title. \u2022 Box score Soroka was taken to a nearby hospital for an MRI exam and thus was not available for postgame interviews. His injury affected the emotions of his teammates and opponents from throughout the league. Cardinals ace Jack Flaherty was among the players who tweeted good wishes soon after the injury occurred, saying, \u201cPrayers up for Soroka.\u201d \"It kind of makes you sick, honestly,\u201d Mets outfielder Michael Conforto said. \u201cI can tell you a lot of us felt that way, just the way he went down and what we were hearing it was. ... We heard it was the Achilles. He's a bright young star, and we know he'll come back and be the same guy.\" While winning seven of their first 11 games, the Braves have shown the potential to have both a strong lineup and bullpen. The primary concern centered on a rotation that could rely on Soroka, Max Fried and maybe hope on the other three days. Now Fried will be carrying the load for a rotation that lost Soroka when he attempted to break off the mound to cover first base on J.D. Davis\u2019 grounder to Freeman. \u201cI heard him yell and then I also heard, \u2018No one is covering first,\u2019 from their first-base coach,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I looked back and saw him on the ground. Didn\u2019t know what the injury was until he got up and couldn\u2019t walk.\u201d Soroka fell to the ground after pushing off the mound with his right foot. He rose a moment later, limped for a few steps and then went back to his knees, where he remained while being checked by assistant trainer Mike Frostad and manager Brian Snitker. \u201cWhen I went out there, [Soroka] said he knew it was [the Achilles],\u201d Snitker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a freak thing that happened. I\u2019m sorry it did.\u201d This will certainly not be a celebratory birthday for Soroka, who turns 23 on Tuesday. He produced the NL\u2019s third-best ERA (2.68) last year and finished second in the NL Rookie of the Year Award balloting. \u201cWhen you lose one of the top pitching arms in this entire game for the whole season, it\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cHe was just about to take off. He was unbelievable as a rookie last year and he was off to an incredible start again.\u201d Overcoming this injury will likely be the Braves\u2019 greatest challenge. Their rotation is now without four projected starters. Cole Hamels (left triceps tendinitis) will not be eligible to be activated from the 45-day injured list until September. F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez elected not to play after reporting to Summer Camp. And Mike Foltynewicz was designated for assignment and outrighted to the alternate training site last week. \u201cNo one is going to feel sorry for us,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cIt has to be next man up. Someone is going to get a great opportunity to fill a role and have a great season.\u201d Maybe Foltynewicz will regain some of the weight he lost and more importantly the velocity his fastball lacked over the past month. Maybe top pitching prospect Ian Anderson will make an impact when he debuts or maybe Kyle Wright will live up to his tremendous potential over the next couple of weeks. The Braves could also attempt to trade for a starter in what could be a thin market as teams account for this year\u2019s expanded playoff field. None of these potential fixes sound as comforting as counting on the consistency Soroka would have continued to bring to the mound every five days.

Mahendra Singh Dhoni may have taken the bails off his international career, but brands aren\u2019t done with him yet. On Saturday, when Dhoni, arguably one of the greatest finishers in the shorter formats of the game, announced his retirement, scores of brands across several industries \u2014 from Amul and Indigo to KFC and Manforce Condoms \u2014 were quick to respond.While Indigo tweeted an ad reminiscing \u2018Captain Cool\u2019s\u2019 trademark shot that said, \u201cThe helicopter has landed\u201d, Manforce Condoms\u2019 tweet punned, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna miss those shots.\u201d Fast-food giant KFC\u2019s message hung the words, \u201cThe greatest finisher\u201d over an empty bucket of fried chicken, while Zomato said it had comfort food if anyone needed it below an image of a number 7 jersey.Brands like Paytm and GoAir also fired their own tweets.\u201cIt\u2019s evident that brands are taking advantage of the situation, given that not much is happening around sports and the interest around him is peaking,\u201d said brand guru and social commentator Santosh Desai. \u201cEven after his retirement, brands would want to associate with Dhoni, similar to what happened with Sachin.\u201dIn fact, Dhoni\u2019s brand valuation ballooned last year to $41.2 million despite India\u2019s exit from the 2019 One Day International (ODI) World Cup held in England and Wales. The Jharkhand cricketer will be the star attraction when he pads up for Chennai Super Kings in the upcoming IPL, a move that may coax brands to capitalise on nostalgic value.The former captain of Team India moved up to the ninth spot in brand rankings from 12th in 2018, according to a Duff & Phelps Celebrity Brand Valuation study. In comparison, Sachin Tendulkar was at number 15 with $25 million, while current skipper Virat Kohli hogged the top spot with $238 million.\u201cGreat players don\u2019t retire, they inspire. Dhoni will continue to do so,\u201d said ad maker Piyush Pandey. \u201cFor a lot of youngsters, Dhoni epitomises the small town spirit, a guy who made it big. Seeing him, they think, \u2018Even I can make it\u2019.\u201d Pandey said brands that treat Dhoni after his retirement as the \u2018new spirit of India\u2019 and not a celebrity will tend to gain from his brand pull.Dhoni was one of the top endorsers for e-commerce and consumer durables companies last year, having been the face for more brands than any other celebrity between January and November 2019, according to estimates by AdEx India and Tam Media Research. And not the one to be caught outside his crease, the 39-year-old made smart investments in internet companies such as Cars24 and Dream11, too, during the period."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.supercars.com:443\/news\/championship\/new-triple-crown-trophy-unveiled\/","domain":"supercars.com","published_date":"2020-08-14 06:55:59","title":"New Triple Crown Trophy Unveiled","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.supercars.com:443\/_next\/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fxd502h20t7lh%2F1hzSbDOTMW4Ikv1ujsSNQz%2F0d3f0109a967d979ed61941d670ce4b7%2F55-1.jpg&w=3840&q=100","content":"\u201cEveryone is going to have the chance to win it this year, so it\u2019s going to be a lot of run trying to hopefully go back-to-back and see if we can get a round win.\u201d"},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/techcentral.co.za\/supersport-is-ditching-channel-numbers-for-genre-channelling\/100165\/","domain":"techcentral.co.za","published_date":"2020-08-03 11:20:00","title":"SuperSport is ditching channel numbers in new line-up","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/techcentral.co.za\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/tc-new-logo-2023-8.png","content":"MultiChoice Group is ditching the channel numbers on its vast SuperSport line-up and introducing football on what is currently known as SuperSport 1 but which will soon be renamed as SuperSport Grandstand.\n\nThe changes will be implemented with effect from 1 September, the pay-television broadcaster said in a statement on Monday.

He has a good boxing IQ, good ability, everything.\n\n\"But do you know what? I\u2019m good too and I believe in myself.\n\nDonovan is deemed the away fighter in this bout\n\n\"I haven\u2019t been tested in my professional career, but that is due to a number of factors. The team I had had very limited resources, the budget, the funding behind me, it was very bottom of the ladder stuff, starting out grafting starting to serve my apprenticeship.\n\n\"And I believe now I have graduated and I am going out on Friday night against a proper opponent in a proper fight, and it\u2019s going to be a cracker.\"\n\nBarrett paid respect to Donovan ahead of the fight at a press conference with no animosity shown between the two boxers, however, he also exuded confidence and predicted that he would put on a show on Friday night and be too good for whatever Donovan threw at him.\n\n\"He\u2019s trying to beat me and I\u2019m there to do a job on him,\" said Barrett.\n\n\"No disrespect but I\u2019m going to look good doing it. And the better he is, the better I will be. And whatever he brings, I\u2019ll out-do it.\"\n\nTipped to be one of the fights of the night in the unique Essex setting, Donovan said that the country was behind him, while he also had a lot of family and support in England, although, obviously, they would not be able to support him at the behind closed doors event.\n\n\"People are excited because you have talent versus talent, you\u2019ve got youth versus experience. He probably trumps me in professional experience but I have a huge amateur pedigree.\n\n\"I do think he will go on to be a big star but I don\u2019t think Friday night is going to be his night.\""},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.autosport.com\/fe\/news\/151305\/new-champion-da-costa-tops-berlin-practice","domain":"autosport.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 10:28:13","title":"Berlin FE: New champion Da Costa tops combined practice","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn-1.motorsport.com\/static\/img\/archive\/autosport\/news\/151305_1005187\/s8\/1005187.jpg","content":"The DS Techeetah driver's 1m15.653s effort in the dying moments, set after the chequered flag had waved, boosted him 0.034s clear of reigning FIA Formula 2 champion de Vries.\n\nMaximilian Guenther had set the pace in opening practice on the 130-metre longer Berlin circuit, despite running with a strapped wrist following his race four shunt into the back of Oliver Turvey.\n\nBut on full power mode, in the shorter 30-minute session, da Costa - who had locked up into Turn 1 of practice one before his car defaulted to neutral - posted a benchmark some 0.6s quicker than Guenther's previous effort as the top 12 cars were covered by less than 0.5s.\n\nJean-Eric Vergne had led the way in the opening minutes of second practice, prior to anyone switching to the 35kW-boosted attack mode, before he way knocked off top spot by de Vries.\n\nBehind Mercedes' de Vries, Sebastien Buemi recovered from a slight graze with the wall to run to third as the Nissan e.dams team continues to show excellent and improved pace following the five-month coronavirus delay.\n\nLucas di Grassi ran to fourth for Audi ahead of second Mercedes pilot Stoffel Vandoorne, who missed the first 12 minutes of the early session after he team supposedly had to change a 12-volt battery in the car, located behind the driver's seat.\n\nDragon Racing's strong one-lap pace continued, as Nico Muller ran to sixth place ahead of Oliver Rowland and Alex Lynn for Mahindra.\n\nIn the second run, despite topping the times mid-way through after his attack mode lap, Guenther fell to ninth ahead of Neel Jani who completed the top 10 for Porsche.\n\nBehind Jani's team-mate Andre Lotterer, Edoardo Mortara beat Jean-Eric Vergne to 12th.\n\nThe closely contested battle for the runner-up sport in the championship means Vergne enters the final double-header second in the points, with just 15 separating him down to Mitch Evans in sixth.\n\nJaguar contender Evans had run strongly in the final sector but reported brake lock ups, meaning his effort was only good enough for 20th.\n\nHis new, short-term team-mate Tom Blomqvist - standing in for World Endurance Championship fixture tied James Calado - ended the session 24th and last, 0.6s behind Evans.\n\nFormula E Berlin Practice 2 results\n\nPos Driver Team Time 1 Antonio Felix da Costa DS Techeetah 1m15.653s 2 Nyck de Vries Mercedes 1m15.687s 3 Sebastien Buemi Nissan e.dams 1m15.752s 4 Lucas di Grassi Audi 1m15.853s 5 Stoffel Vandoorne Mercedes 1m15.882s 6 Nico Muller Dragon 1m15.899s 7 Oliver Rowland Nissan e.dams 1m15.910s 8 Alex Lynn Mahindra 1m15.993s 9 Maximilian Guenther BMW 1m16.073s 10 Neel Jani Porsche 1m16.133s 11 Andre Lotterer Porsche 1m16.136s 12 Edoardo Mortara Venturi 1m16.144s 13 Jean-Eric Vergne DS Techeetah 1m16.158s 14 Jerome d'Ambrosio Mahindra 1m16.163s 15 Felipe Massa Venturi 1m16.170s 16 Sergio Sette Camara Dragon 1m16.191s 17 Sam Bird Virgin 1m16.358s 18 Robin Frijns Virgin 1m16.402s 19 Daniel Abt NIO 1m16.420s 20 Mitch Evans Jaguar 1m16.486s 21 Alexander Sims BMW 1m16.529s 22 Oliver Turvey NIO 1m16.701s 23 Rene Rast Audi 1m16.755s 24 Tom Blomqvist Jaguar 1m17.070s\n\n\n\n"},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/orlandomagicdaily.com\/2020\/08\/06\/orlando-magic-grades-toronto-raptors-109-orlando-magic-99-2\/","domain":"orlandomagicdaily.com","published_date":"2020-08-06 13:29:00","title":"Orlando Magic Grades: Toronto Raptors 109, Orlando Magic 99","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images2.minutemediacdn.com\/image\/upload\/c_fill,w_720,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto\/shape\/cover\/sport\/d602e8038ad682f7c4df3bbdec35a4b994c67ebe823489325deb805fbb2422c5.jpg","content":"B+.

other in the semis, raising the prospect of the Red Devils coming up against two former players if they reach the final.\n\nBut Lukaku wasn't looking ahead to a potential reunion after Wednesday's win, insisting he is focused on next week's quarter-final.\n\n\"I\u2019m happy for the victory and also for Christian [Eriksen] who scored an important goal for us,\" said Lukaku.\n\n\"We must

one-off game having been switched to a neutral venue due to coronavirus concerns.\n\nGetafe, who finished eighth in La Liga, started strongly and went close to an opener when Nemanja Maksimovic's header was superbly saved by Inter keeper Samir Handanovic.\n\nInter responded with Argentine striker Lautaro Martinez twice forcing good saves from David Soria before Lukaku opened the scoring, latching on to a long ball, holding off Xabier Etxeita and drilling into the bottom corner.\n\nGetafe responded well after the break with Jaime Mata seeing a header tipped over by Handanovic before they were given a great chance to equalise when VAR spotted a handball in the box by Inter defender Diego Godin.\n\nYet 38-year-old substitute Jorge Molina put his poorly-struck penalty wide and from then on Inter never looked in danger.\n\nLukaku, who has now scored in his last eight Europa League matches, missed a golden chance from close range, but Inter made sure of the win through substitute Eriksen.\n\nMoments after being introduced, the former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder made no mistake as he took full advantage of a poor attempted clearance from Djene

Trent Jr. used the seeding games to do exactly that. Opinions about his game and potential changed during the past two weeks, when he shot 51.6% overall and 50.7% on 3-pointers, too, during the restart. He came up huge in the Blazers\u2019 seeding games, including the finale in which he hit a key 3-pointer late and exhausted himself trying to defend LeVert down the stretch.\n\nMikal Bridges, Phoenix Suns\n\nSeason restart stats: 12.8 ppg | 4.1 rpg | 1.8 apg | 1.1 spg\n\nDevin Booker and Ricky Rubio were the headliners during the Suns\u2019 unbeaten run through the seeding games. But Bridges used the time to show off his game, too. Suns coach Monty Williams put him on Luka Doncic and Kawhi Leonard during crunch time in games against those playoff-bound powers, which says all you need to know about his defensive prowess. Check the tape on Booker\u2019s game-winner against the Clippers and you\u2019ll see Bridges making the play that made it possible.\n\nKristaps Porzingis, Dallas Mavericks\n\nSeason restart stats: 30.5 ppg | 9.5 rpg | 2.2 apg | 1.5 bpg\n\nThe man Kevin Durant dubbed \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d was a force for the Mavericks in the seeding games, leading them in scoring (slightly ahead of Luka Doncic) while also shooting 38.1% on 3-pointers. There\u2019s no questioning the talent of Porzingis, who has the ability to join Doncic on the All-Star team for years to come. What we\u2019re going to find out in the playoffs against the Clippers is if he\u2019s ready to bump and grind against the likes of Montrezl Harrell. If the answer is yes, oh boy \u2026\n\nBol Bol, Denver Nuggets\n\nSeason restart stats: 5.3 ppg | 2.5 rpg\n\nWe\u2019re stepping out on faith after seeing Bol in limited glimpses, he averaged 11.9 minutes on a loaded frontcourt rotation that also has Porter Jr. and Jerami Grant to work with alongside Jokic and Paul Millsap. But none of them bring the dimensions and skill in the package Bol does. He\u2019s got two-guard tools in his bag and will only get more lethal as his confidence grows. The future frontline of Jokic, Porter Jr. and Bol is an absolute freakshow in the making.\n\nLuguentz Dort, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nSeason restart stats: 9.1 ppg | 3.9 rpg | 1.1 spg\n\nThe undrafted rookie started the season on one of the Thunder\u2019s two-way contracts, earned a starting job by January (the Thunder went 16-5 with him in the starting lineup before the March hiatus) and signed a four-year deal before the action began in the bubble. He\u2019s the sort of junkyard defensive dog the Thunder will need alongside Chris Paul against James Harden and Russell Westbrook in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n* * *\n\nSekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Those entering the paddock must produce a negative COVID-19 test upon arrival to each race, with regular temperature checks carried out.\n\nThe paddock deploys its own track and trace app, with social bubbles in operation to avoid any interaction to cut down on possible virus spread. Motorsport.com learned earlier on Saturday that a member of MotoGP promoter Dorna Sports' TV team had a presumptive positive test for the virus.\n\nDorna has now confirmed this in a statement: \"After more than 5,500 tests performed on all paddock personnel before their attendance to the Spanish, Andalusia and Czech GPs, one person in the FIM MotoGP World Championship paddock has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"The result was returned during testing undertaken ahead of the Austrian Grand Prix. The person is a member of Dorna Sports\u2019 team and is asymptomatic. Following the positive result that arrived early on Saturday, the person was immediately informed and isolated in their hotel.\n\n\"A further test was then undertaken in order to confirm the result. This second test also proved positive and therefore the staff member and all close contacts will remain in isolation. Local health authorities will now decide on the duration of self-isolation they are required to undertake.\n\n\"As a precautionary measure, the Championship has taken the decision to test any persons in secondary contact with the individual and each of them has returned a negative result. The unnamed individual has been placed into quarantine, as have all those who have had direct contact as a precaution.\"\n\nThis comes just a week after Racing Point Formula 1 driver Sergio Perez tested positive for the virus, which forced him out of last weekend's Silverstone race and this week's 70th Anniversary Grand Prix at the same venue.\n\nOn Thursday ahead of the Czech GP, leading MotoGP riders admitted the Perez situation left them \"worried\".\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has forced MotoGP to alter it calendar, with its original 20-race schedule scrapped in favour of a 14-round calendar of exclusively European rounds. Last week Dorna announced it had axed the flyaway events in Argentina, Thailand and Malaysia that hadn't been cancelled for 2020 beforehand, but would add a 14th race.\n\nMotorsport.com understands the new final round of 2020 will take place in Portugal with the inaugural MotoGP race at the Algarve circuit and the first race in the country since 2012.

There's a number of them here in this country for tennis and the likes but they are way smaller than this,\" Connacht Council secretary John Prenty said.\n\nChallenge\n\n\"But (the engineers) hadn't gone to that size before. \"It's 150m long by 100m wide, the biggest ones they had done were about 140m by 70m. The challenge from a GAA point of view was the ends because it has to be high enough, it's 26m high.\"\n\nThe structure also includes a full-sized pitch, a running track and a gym. And by the time it opens, it will be able to accommodate 600 people. That figure could go as high as 10,000 with extra seating installed in the venue.\n\n\"It was always in our plans to have some kind of indoor facility with the weather we have down here in the west of Ireland,\" Prenty continued.\n\n\"We did our pitches first and main building and then started looking at what kind of a building we could build. We explored the possibility of building a conventional building but it was always in our head that we would like a full-sized pitch covered. But a conventional building that size would cost maybe \u20ac25-50m, (but) God knows what it would cost.\n\n\"When we saw those costs we decided it was not going to happen. And then we started to look around at other options and came across the option of an air dome. We were in Abbotstown (the national GAA centre of excellence) the day they opened it and we met the engineers who had been here (in Bekan). They had been at a trade show or a sports exhibition in Germany and they came across a company that were doing air domes.\"\n\nThe dome won't be fully open until September at the earliest and the restrictions on indoor gatherings, currently limited to 50, are a further complication.\n\nHowever, Prenty believes the venue could even be used to host Connacht championship games later this year if required.\n\n\"At the minute the ground works are going on on the outside (of the dome). That will take another four or five weeks. The actual dome manufacturers are finished this weekend.\n\n\"Then it will be a matter of getting the outside organised with entrances and it could be open for business by the end of September, depending on Covid (restrictions).\"\n\nThe idea of the Connacht final being played in Croke Park was mooted earlier this year, in order to accommodate as many supporters as possible. However, should restrictions on attendances remain in place as the inter-county scene returns, Prenty believes the Dome could see major action before the end of 2020.\n\n\"If we are going to have behind closed doors, you could play the whole Connacht championship there (in the Dome) if you wanted to. We have cameras in it that we can stream games from.\n\n\"If it's going to be a few hundred there's no need to go anywhere. We have to wait and see what happens but the venue won't become an issue if there's a limit.\n\n\"If it is going to be 500, I don't know if it will be worth having any crowds? Because you see the hassle clubs have with the 200 limit. So what if you have Mayo and Galway in a Connacht final and there's only 500 (tickets)? It would be easier to have nobody.\""},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/in.nba.com\/news\/who-would-you-rather-have-for-the-next-three-years-luka-doncic-and-kristaps-porzingis-or-kawhi-leonard-and-paul-george\/bkx776k1qvu919kolgshtw9m6","domain":"in.nba.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 18:28:00","title":"Who would you rather have for the next three years: Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis or Kawhi Leonard and Paul George?","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/library.sportingnews.com\/styles\/crop_style_16_9_desktop\/s3\/2021-08\/george-doncic-ftrjpg_i6ngbja8mxfl17umcnjp0rfho.jpg?itok=JV9JMj2B","content":"When the LA Clippers and Dallas Mavericks face off in the first round of the 2020 NBA Playoffs, two of the NBA's best duos will go head to head.\n\nOne on side: Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, two bonafide All-Stars who have hopes of winning a title together this season. On the other: Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis, two one-time All-Stars who have the potential to dominate the league for the next decade.\n\nSERIES PREVIEW: Clippers vs. Mavericks\n\nThat got our NBA.com Staff wondering. While Leonard and George might be the better right duo now, would you rather have them for the next three seasons or Doncic and Porzingis?\n\nGilbert McGregor (@GMcGregor21): Potential is nice and all, but for the next three seasons? I'm taking Kawhi and PG-13.\n\nRight now, I think Dallas is entering a span of years in which it will gradually advance further and further in the postseason. For LA? It's title or bust each and every year that it has Leonard and George in tow.\n\nKawhi is 29, PG is 30, and I can see the two having about three more great seasons alongside one another left anyway. Once those years end, I think we won't have to look far for the next duo to take over and dominate the league.\n\nChampionships are very hard to win, but I'd be surprised if Leonard and George don't raise a banner of their own in the Staples Center by 2023. As for KP and Luka? I see their peak over the next three years as a few wins in the conference finals, which isn't bad at all.\n\nJust sign me up for the titles.\n\nBenyam Kidane (@BenyamKidane): A lot can change in three years, that's why I'm rolling with Luka and KP.\n\nAre the Clippers a better team than the Mavs. Yes. But for how long?\n\nThe Mavericks already have their foundation for the next decade in place with Luka Doncic and Kirstaps Porzingis forming one of the most lethal, inside-out combos in the league and as a no.7 seed in their first real season year together, they're giving big 2009-10 Oklahoma City Thunder vibes.\n\nDoncic might be 21, but he plays like he's been in the league for 10 years and could well end up as an MVP in the next three seasons.\n\nI don't think it would surprise anyone if the Mavericks built on this season's development and put themselves in the mix at the top of the Western Conference in 2020-21. They already have the No.1 offence in the league, but if their defence catches up, I'm sure we'll be mentioning them in the same breath as the Clippers, Lakers and co. in the coming seasons.\n\nThe Clippers' title window is right now, but will they get much better than they are currently constructed? The sky is the limit for Luka and KP.\n\nYash Matange (@yashmatange2694): If you had asked me who I would have wanted in 5-10 years, I might have picked the international duo of Luka and KP but for three years, I'm going Kawhi Leonard and Paul George.\n\nYes, the Mavericks have the best offense in the league and their two best players have not even at their prime from an age and talent standpoint. However, for a duration as short as three years, I would prefer picking something tried and tested. Kawhi Leonard is all of that.\n\nWhen it matters, in the postseason, he's the best two-way player in the league. At least, until somebody outplays him. Paul George is one of the best possible No. 2 possible.

Eight days later, he had u-turned again and resigned.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nRangnick departed RB Leipzig just a fortnight ago, despite strong interest in him from Milan, who looked set to install him in a joint manager and sporting director role.\n\nAfter that move collapsed, Rangnick had agreed a new two-year deal with Leipzig, only to then quit a few days later. His next move is still unclear - but it will certainly be worth noting for Liverpool fans.\n\nOn a special podcast looking into the relationship between the Red Bull clubs and Liverpool FC, Guido Schaefer, a former teammate of Klopp at Mainz in the 1990s and is now a journalist covering Leipzig, explained the influence that Rangnick has had on the Reds.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nGet the best Liverpool stories straight to your inbox with our Reds newsletter READ MORE:\n\nNike chief explains colour scheme on new Liverpool away kit READ MORE:\n\nSchaefer said: \"Rangick inspired Jurgen Klopp\u2019s style to play football and Klopp saw the match and the idea from Hoffenheim, and said \u2018yes, this is nice\u2019.\n\n\"It\u2019s not a copy of the style [completely] but Klopp said \u2018I want to play with young, fast players\u2019 and players who don\u2019t ask \u2018why should I run so much?\u2019.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"Jurgen said \u2018we have to invest more in a match than Bayern Munich and because of this investment, Dortmund won the title in Germany twice.\n\n\"The quality of Bayern was much higher than but the brain, the power, the [physical] investment from Dortmund was on a higher standard.\n\n\"Were Liverpool the best team in Europe last season?

Despite having been given a new chassis for this race, Vettel still fell out of Q2, finishing 0.002 seconds behind the last Q3 qualifier Lando Norris. As a result, Vettel will start the race in P11 for the third time this season. Another disappointing qualifying has left Vettel so miffed that he preferred not to utter a single word during the entire session.\n\nHis race engineer was in constant contact with Vettel, giving him information and orders throughout his runs. However, Vettel, in return, didn\u2019t acknowledge nor deny anything he was told. Usually, after Qualifying, Vettel makes it a point to give feedback to the team. But not this time. This time there was only silence.\n\nThe transcripts from this silent drama went down like this, Q1 (first run), \u201cTo Vettel \u2013 Kvyat and Stroll on out lap.

The deafening silence attests to that fact better than any words can. Before the race weekend began, Vettel seemed optimistic about improving his performances. But after that, it looks unlikely.\n\nThe team just can\u2019t seem to get to the bottom of the problem with Vettel\u2019s SF1000. Even a chassis change hasn\u2019t helped. What more can they do? What more can poor Seb do? How much longer has he to suffer until he gets out of this toxic relationship with the Scuderia?\n\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\n\nUltimately, for the Tifosi and Vettel fans, it\u2019s heartbreaking to watch. A 4-times world champion deserves so much better. However, the race isn\u2019t done. Vettel still has a chance to put a smile on his face and that of his fans with a performance that can get him into the points. Can he deliver in a struggling machine?

Aged 21, the young Jewish tennis star had reached the Wimbledon women\u2019s singles and doubles finals. She was also the first home player to contest a singles final for 17 years. Her mother, Violet, ecstatic at her daughter\u2019s success, was desperate to attend the Friday night Wimbledon Ball to see Angela open the dancing with Lew Hoad, the Australian tennis player and heart-throb. What she and her daughter encountered, however, was ill-disguised antisemitism.\n\n\u201cWe went to the LTA [Lawn Tennis Association] office at Wimbledon and asked for a ball ticket for my mother,\u201d Buxton recalled in 2019. \u201cThe lady said she hadn\u2019t got any left. That really annoyed my mother, who drew herself up to her full 5ft 2in and said, \u2018Well, I\u2019m awfully sorry, too. I\u2019m going to keep my daughter in on Saturday. Come on, Angela. Good day.\u2019 The lady suddenly realised what my absence would mean and as we went up the concourse, there was a tap on my mother\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cWe went back to the LTA\u2019s inner sanctum, where the lady said: \u2018I\u2019m awfully sorry about that. Here\u2019s two tickets.\u2019 They wouldn\u2019t have done that to any other British player.\u201d\n\nAlthough Buxton, overcome with nerves, lost to Shirley Fry in the singles final, she and the American player Althea Gibson \u2014 the first black woman to compete at Wimbledon \u2014 made history in the doubles. Already the French Open champions, they had beaten Fry and Louise Brough in the Wimbledon semis and outhit the Australians Fay Muller and Daphne Seeney to take the doubles crown 6-1, 8-6. \u201cThe next day one newspaper reported it under the headline \u2018Minorities win\u2019,\u201d Buxton said sardonically. \u201cIt was in very small type, lest anyone should see it.\u201d\n\nShe flew the flag for Jewish athletes who were widely treated as outcasts among the genteel middle-class tennis establishment of 1950s England. Although forced to retire in 1957 with a severe wrist injury, she later became a well-known coach and tennis writer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer close friendship with Gibson, who would win the women\u2019s singles title at Wimbledon in 1957 and 1958, became a defining part of Buxton\u2019s career, since both saw themselves as having been ostracised in the sport they loved. Buxton was unable to become a member of tennis clubs in both Britain and the United States because she was Jewish, while Gibson was equally handicapped by her colour. On the international circuit, they naturally gravitated towards each other, forming initially a tennis partnership and then a lifelong friendship that included Buxton raising about $1 million in 1995, when Gibson was destitute and on the brink of suicide.\n\nAngela Buxton was born in 1934 in Liverpool to a Russian-Jewish couple whose families had fled persecution in the 1890s. Her father, Harry, a flamboyant would-be entrepreneur and small-time street trader, made a fortune when he and his brother developed a system for gambling on blackjack. Despite widespread derision, they pooled their meagre savings and travelled to the south of France, where they broke the bank. Harry bought a chain of cinemas around Manchester with the proceeds and gave his family all the privileges he had never had, sending his wife, Violet, with Angela, then six, and her brother to South Africa to escape the Blitz.\n\nBuxton, right, celebrates after winning the 1956 ladies doubles at Wimbledon with Althea Gibson BETTMANN\n\nThere Angela enjoyed playing hopscotch with their maid\u2019s daughter and was furious when she was told that white children could not play with black children. A tough, strongly built child with an implacable will to win, she received tennis coaching, showing early promise and continuing to play when she was sent to the girls\u2019 boarding school Gloddaeth Hall in north Wales.\n\nAt 13 she entered her first tournament, at Hightown, Merseyside, sensationally winning every age group, including the under-18s. Buxton\u2019s parents divorced but both remained eager for her to fulfil her potential as a tennis player. When Violet moved to London with the children and booked lessons for Angela at the prestigious Cumberland club, however, the gifted young player was refused membership because she was Jewish. Angela then travelled with her mother to California, so that she could train at the exclusive Los Angeles Tennis Club, but once they realised her religion she was again barred from playing. This opposition only strengthened her resolve to succeed. She was spotted playing on public courts by the former Wimbledon champion \u201cBig\u201d Bill Tilden. He became Buxton\u2019s coach and she improved her game hitting with the future Grand Slam champions Pancho Gonzales and Pancho Segura. Tilden coached many Hollywood celebrities on Charlie Chaplin\u2019s court; Buxton played regularly with Chaplin and Doris Day, while the likes of Walter Pidgeon and Katharine Hepburn watched and even served as ballboy and ballgirl.\n\nAfter she returned home in 1953, Buxton\u2019s confidence was shattered when the American Doris Hart, winner of six Grand Slam singles titles, thrashed her 6-0 6-0 at Bournemouth. She planned to retire from the game but Clarence \u201cJimmy\u201d Jones, a journalist and former Davis Cup player, met her at a bus stop and offered to coach her. It was the beginning of a fruitful sporting partnership which, much later, led to a long-term romantic relationship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones trained Buxton at Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields in what he termed \u201cPattern Tennis\u201d, a series of set moves and strokes to dominate opponents. He also emphasised physical fitness and psychological domination, telling her: \u201cWhen you are on court, I want people almost to revere you, like the Queen of England.\u201d The feisty Buxton had no trouble assuming an imperious fa\u00e7ade and bounced back from her defeat to win the 1953 Maccabiah Games in Israel, a title she retained in 1957.\n\nShe rapidly joined the top table of British women\u2019s tennis, which then included Shirley Bloomer, Pat Ward and Angela Mortimer, but made few friends among her contemporaries or tennis organisers.\n\n\u201cThe Southport club wouldn\u2019t let me practise there,\u201d she recalled, \u201ceven though I was No 1 in England by then, so a member took me there as his guest. I took great delight in winning their tournament. As I rose up the rankings, the British girls on the international circuit ignored me. Playing out in Mexico, they never once invited me to join them for a meal.\u201d\n\nSince tennis was then amateur, Buxton, who loved fashion, began working for the Piccadilly department store Lillywhites, which allowed her time off for practice and competitions. In 1955 she was the only British woman to reach the singles quarter-finals at Wimbledon. While playing on the tournament circuit in India, she met Gibson, whom President Eisenhower had sent on a goodwill tour with the American player Karol Fageros. \u201cThey were a great visual contrast,\u201d recalled Buxton. \u201cKarol blonde, glamorous and famous for wearing gold lam\u00e9 panties designed by [tennis couturier] Teddy Tinling. Althea tall, slim, powerful, wearing vests and shorts and playing tennis like a man. It was a deliberate choice to show the world symbolically that black and white people could play together.\u201d\n\nBuxton pictured last year. After retiring as a player she wrote numerous books and articles on tennis RICHARD CANNON\n\nGibson, the daughter of poor share-croppers, had been brought up penniless in New York and had fought for years for the right to play against white people rather than simply on the black-player circuit, which she had dominated from her teens. Buxton was fascinated by Gibson\u2019s dry humour, self-belief and fine singing voice (she later became the only Wimbledon champion to sing at the ball and, encouraged by Buxton, even recorded pop songs).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite being among the world\u2019s best, neither had a doubles partner for the 1956 French Open. \u201cAlthea was still fighting the black barrier,\u201d Buxton said. \u201cI remember her sitting on the sideline when I was playing the 1956 Wightman Cup against America at Wimbledon. I was thinking, \u2018What the hell is she sitting there for?\u2019 One of the best players in the world and she wasn\u2019t chosen.\u201d\n\nJimmy Jones brokered the partnership, though Gibson\u2019s high expectations could make her a tough and demanding ally. \u201cShe brought this attitude,\u201d remembers Buxton. \u201cIf I missed a volley she\u2019d give me a filthy look. When we lost at Queen\u2019s Club, Jimmy said to her, \u2018Do you know you\u2019re putting Angela off with your attitude?\u2019 Jimmy arranged for us to play a match against him and another man and he told her, \u2018You just concentrate on being nice to Angela when she makes a mistake; you\u2019ll do far better as a team\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe advice worked. The pair won the French Open doubles and then the Wimbledon title which cemented their status in the sport.\n\nAfter her enforced retirement, Buxton married Donald Silk, the president of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain. They had three children but the marriage did not last. Their two sons, Ben and Joseph, worked in finance and both predeceased her. Her daughter, Rebecca, who ran a successful business selling audiobooks, is married to Jonathan Djanogly, the Conservative MP for Huntingdon.\n\nBuxton went on to write numerous books and articles on tennis and, with her partner Jones, set up the Angela Buxton Tennis Centre in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London. The future Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, was among her pupils and also worked there as a coach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones died in 1986 and Buxton sold the centre the following year, subsequently dividing her life between England and Florida.\n\nShe always resented the lack of recognition she received from the British tennis establishment for her achievements; she was never made a member of the All England Club, an omission that rankled until the end of her life.\n\nAngela Buxton, tennis player and writer, was born on August 16, 1934. She died of frailty and old age on August 15, 2020, aged 85"},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk\/sport\/football\/football-news\/man-city-news-transfers-live-18779974","domain":"manchestereveningnews.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-16 22:55:00","title":"Man City news and transfers LIVE Lionel Messi and Kalidou Koulibaly latest","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.jwplayer.com\/v2\/media\/RuMfblVm\/poster.jpg","content":"Graeme Souness has encouraged Manchester City to make an ambitious move to sign Lionel Messi.\n\nBarcelona face an inquisition after their humiliating Champions League quarter-final exit at hands of Bayern Munich, who beat them 8-2 in Lisbon on Thursday.\n\nA mass exodus could be on the cards to rejuvenate the squad and, despite his legendary status at Barcelona, it has been suggested that Messi could end his stint in Catalonia.

Sign up here for our All Access Daily newsletter.\n\nIncluding, I'd imagine, some in Philadelphia.\n\nHere's what Hield had to say:\n\n[Hield] provided a series of short answers during a Zoom session with reporters and offered a cryptic response when asked if he could be content with his role going into next season. \"Y'all know me,\" Hield said. \"Y'all know how I talk. Y'all know how I feel. Y'all can read me well, so I'll let y'all answer that yourselves.\"\n\nPretty spicy. That doesn't sound like someone who wants to stay where he is!\n\nHield signed a four-year extension with Sacramento last October, but the Kings regressed in their first year under head coach Luke Walton, and The Athletic reported in February that Hield, unhappy with his role, might be eyeing a move elsewhere.\n\nIt doesn't sound like Hield's concerns about his role have changed much since then. If he's unhappy, he could theoretically ask for a trade - or Sacramento could pre-emptively try to get something for the still-young shooter.\n\nI examined the potential fit back in April, including the hypothetical Hield-for-Horford deal from that fateful Instagram post:\n\nIn terms of contract length and salary hit, the Hield and Horford deals are strikingly similar, and Hield's game would be an instant improvement for the Sixers' offensive spacing: he's a two-guard who shoots a career 41.1 percent from deep, and can create his own shot. Plus, he's substantially younger than Horford. Will the move happen? If the Kings deem their relationship with Hield unfixable, it's possible. Horford hasn't fit well in Philly, but he's still a savvy veteran with a good track record. And Hield would certainly check the boxes for the Sixers' front office.\n\nHield shot 39% from deep this year on 9.5 (!) three-point attempts per game, is a career 41% three-point shooter over 315 games, and would be a perfect match for the Sixers.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nSubscribe and rate Sixers Talk:\n\nApple Podcasts \/ Google Play \/ Spotify \/ Stitcher \/ Art19 \/ YouTube\n\nClick here to download the MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

Not Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, rated by many as the best No 9 in the Premier League. Not R\u00faben Neves or Jo\u00e3o Moutinho, the wily schemers at the heart of the Wolves midfield. No, wholly predictably, it was the only man on the field with lubrication on his bulging biceps that dominated discussion of the early stages.\n\nAdama Traor\u00e9 oils up his arms to deter opponents who would otherwise be left in his wake from trying to pull him back illegally. Traor\u00e9 is so quick he leaves lots of defenders attempting to stop him by any means possible, and there had been some debate beforehand about his best starting position. Some felt he would be best deployed on the right, even if Sevilla possess an accomplished left-back in the Real Madrid loanee Sergio Regu\u00edlon, all the better to supply Jim\u00e9nez with crosses from the by-line.\n\nNuno Esp\u00edrito Santo decided to use him through the middle, perhaps aware that Sevilla would defend with an obligingly high line. Traor\u00e9 began with a little cameo of his former right-winger self, darting down the right flank with only 30 seconds on the clock to send over a cross for Jim\u00e9nez to bring a save from Yassine Bounou with his first touch, but it was what the former Barcelona player did 10 minutes later that justified his manager\u2019s faith, or would have done had Jim\u00e9nez been able to score from the penalty spot.\n\nBreaking from well inside his own half, Traor\u00e9 set off on a scything run that took him all the way into the penalty area, where he was brought down by an ankle tap from Diego Carlos in the act of preparing to shoot.\n\nGiven Traor\u00e9\u2019s occasionally erratic finishing this seemed the best of all outcomes for Wolves, who by that stage had done enough to deserve an 11th minute lead, yet the normally reliable Jim\u00e9nez waited for the goalkeeper to make the first move in an unconvincing run-up and was confounded when Bounou stood his ground. There was a suggestion the goalkeeper was slightly off his line when Jim\u00e9nez struck the ball, yet it would only have been a measurement in millimetres, and the shot itself was well below the Mexican\u2019s normal standard.\n\nView image in fullscreen Adama Traor\u00e9 watches on as Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez sees his early penalty saved by Yassine Bounou of Sevilla. Photograph: Stuart Franklin\/UEFA\/Getty Images\n\nAfter the decisive inroads Traor\u00e9 had made, an easily saved penalty was the last thing Wolves needed, especially as they have a good record of hanging on to early leads. And the let-off seemed to act as a spur to their opponents \u2013 suddenly there was less space behind the backline.\n\nSuddenly Traor\u00e9 was being surrounded by three players every time he saw the ball, which was less and less often because by the interval Sevilla were getting forward more than their opponents and taking a grip of the game.\n\nIt was time for Wolves to dig in, in other words, and they did so quite impressively, defending with discipline and organisation. Rui Patr\u00edcio made a couple of scrambling saves in the first half, but for the most part the defensive screen kept him well protected until Youssef En-Nesyri toe-poked a shot at him after an hour.\n\nJes\u00fas Navas did find space for Joan Jordan at around the same stage of the game, but Leander Dendoncker was across quickly to cut out the danger from Lucas Ocampos in the middle. More worrying from a Wolves point of view was the complete lack of action at the other end.\n\nBounou was a virtual spectator for a full hour following his penalty save. Without so much as a sniff of a chance to strike on the counter, Traor\u00e9 was withdrawn 10 minutes from the end, the player that terrorised Manchester City earlier in the season finding only closed doors and dead-ends to run into against more composed defenders.\n\nThat seemed to confirm a defence-dominated game was heading for extra time, though if Wolves were contemplating that possibility a couple of minutes too early they were caught out by quick-thinking from Sevilla\u2019s best attackers, Suso and \u00c9ver Banega. The former forced a late corner, taken quickly to allow Banega to cross on the diagonal, and a perfect headed finish by Ocampos did the rest. Effectively Banega cut out the big men in the Wolves rearguard by inviting Ocampos to come short for the ball. Though it was a cruel ending for Wolves, long before the end there was only one side creating openings."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.manilatimes.net\/2020\/08\/12\/sports\/sports-top\/laureano-says-astros-coach-sparks-fracas\/754053\/","domain":"manilatimes.net","published_date":"2020-08-11 16:17:14","title":"Laureano Says Astros Coach Sparks Fracas \u2013 The Manila Times","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn4.premiumread.com\/?url=https:\/\/www.manilatimes.net\/theme_manilatimes\/images\/TMT_1920x1008.jpg&w=1920&q=100&f=webp&v=1","content":"ANAHEIM, California: Oakland outfielder Ramon Laureano says Houston Astros hitting coach \u00c1lex Cintr\u00f3n made a crude remark about his mother that prompted a benches-clearing incident on Sunday (Monday in Manila), and Athletics manager Bob Melvin wants Cintr\u00f3n punished harshly by Major League Baseball.\n\nLaureano said on Monday (Tuesday in Manila) he regrets charging toward Houston\u2019s dugout to fight Cintr\u00f3n after the two exchanged words during the seventh inning of a game Sunday in Oakland."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.thisisanfield.com\/2020\/08\/photos-anfield-gets-a-nike-makeover\/","domain":"thisisanfield.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 14:49:11","title":"Photos: Anfield gets a Nike makeover","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.thisisanfield.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/AnfieldNIKE-600x400.jpg","content":"Anfield has received a makeover and ushered in another new era, with the deal with Nike now taking centre-stage both in and outside the stadium.\n\nHaving ticked over into August, believe it or not, Liverpool\u2019s deal with Nike took flight for the first-ever collaboration between the two parties.\n\nThe lucrative deal with the American sportswear company came into effect over the weekend which meant they became the club\u2019s sixth kit manufacturer in the process, with New Balance bidding farewell.\n\nAnd with a change in kit and supplier, comes a change at Anfield both inside and out as the Reds mark their new collaboration in style.\n\nOn the exterior, the Kop\u2019s usual collage for the new season\u2019s kit received a timely update, with the new home shirt taking centre stage, with shots of Jordan Henderson, Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah and Liverpool Women\u2018s Melissa Lawley.\n\nThe images are adorned with the slogan: \u201cTell us Never,\u201d one which initially confused some.\n\nBut it\u2019s a tag which touches on the doubters and the naysayers, that if someone says it can\u2019t be done, Liverpool will do it or have already done it.\n\nAnd the same message is displayed on the hording on the side of The Albert Pub at Anfield.\n\nInside the ground, work is already underway in replacing seats at the Anfield Road end which will now see the Nike swoosh replace the \u2018NB\u2019 of New Balance:\n\nNike starting to make their mark at Anfield ?? pic.twitter.com\/QaxxwMlRZ6 \u2014 DD ?? #BlackLivesMatter (@decayingcactus) August 2, 2020\n\nFurther changes apply to the club shop, of course, with the skipper adorning a large proportion of the window display thus far.\n\nAnd inside, the club are celebrating both their new partnership with Nike and their status as Premier League champions.\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2018s side will now be aiming to retain their Premier League crown in their new Nike kit, one which has received mixed reviews since its official launch.\n\nBut nevertheless, it remains an exciting time and one which keeps pushing the benchmark for a Liverpool side who are still as hungry as ever to add more trophies to the cabinet.\n\n* The new Liverpool home kit is available to order from the online Nike store."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/mmajunkie.usatoday.com\/2020\/08\/ufc-254-daniel-cormier-surprised-by-khabib-nurmagomedov-return-after-father-death","domain":"mmajunkie.usatoday.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 12:02:52","title":"Daniel Cormier was 'taken a little aback' by Khabib Nurmagomedov returning at UFC 254","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/mmajunkie.usatoday.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/91\/2017\/07\/mmaj-header-logo.png?w=659","content":"It was a short time ago when Daniel Cormier expressed uncertainty about Khabib Nurmagomedov\u2019s fighting future in the wake of his father, Abdulmanap, passing away.\n\nThen Nurmagomedov (28-0 MMA, 12-0 UFC) was booked to defend his lightweight title against Justin Gaethje (22-2 MMA, 5-2 UFC) at UFC 254 on Oct. 24, and many were surprised about the timeline.\n\nCormier and Nurmagomedov are good friends and teammates at American Kickboxing Academy in San Jose. Cormier has seen first hand how tightly bound the relationship between the Nurmagomedovs was, as it extended well beyond just a father and son. It was also a coach and a pupil, and Nurmagomedov not having that presence heading into a fight was thought to possibly be too much to bare.\n\nCormier had previously vocalized his concerns about how soon, if ever, \u201cThe Eagle\u201d would soar back into the octagon. The lightweight title unification bout is now official with interim champ Gaethje, and Cormier said it\u2019s a welcomed surprise to see Nurmagomedov getting back to work this soon.\n\n\u201cI was a little nervous initially,\u201d Cormier told MMA Junkie. \u201cNot nervous, I was taken a little aback. After I did the show (for ESPN talking about it) I had heard that Khabib was looking more at getting going sooner than later. So, when the announcement was made, it didn\u2019t surprise me because I had an inclination it was going to happen. But I thought he would be away for a while. But nothing makes me happier than my champion coming back and defending his belt.\u201d\n\nCormier has an important fight of his own coming up. He\u2019s slated to challenge Stipe Miocic for the heavyweight title in an anticipated trilogy bout Aug. 15 at UFC 252.

The emotion of watching Nurmagomedov compete is a lot to handle, though, and would also provide a challenge to stay unbiased.\n\nFor that reason, Cormier said it\u2019s likely he won\u2019t be in the booth for Nurmagomedov vs. Gaethje at UFC 254.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably going to step back,\u201d Cormier said.\n\n[jwplayer xNdMJwzG-RbnemIYZ]"},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/mmajunkie.usatoday.com\/2020\/08\/daniel-cormier-reacts-nba-star-autograph-snub-2004-olympics","domain":"mmajunkie.usatoday.com","published_date":"2020-08-14 00:22:30","title":"How an autograph snub by an NBA star helped Daniel Cormier deal with future fame","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/mmajunkie.usatoday.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/91\/2017\/07\/mmaj-header-logo.png?w=659","content":"When it comes to fighting, former UFC dual champion Daniel Cormier is unquestionably one of the all-time greatest to ever do it, but it\u2019s how he\u2019s carried himself throughout his career that makes him special.\n\nWhat can you say about DC other than \u2026 he\u2019s just a good guy.\n\nThat\u2019s as cliche as it gets, but it\u2019s true. It\u2019s why Max Holloway calls Cormier \u201cthe daddest man on the planet.\u201d He\u2019s a father who, by all accounts, is a good man who just so happens to be great at fighting.\n\nIf you know somebody (other than Jon Jones) who actually hates DC? I\u2019d love to hear it.\n\nAs UFC 252 and his heavyweight title trilogy with Stipe Miocic draws near, there\u2019s a lot of reflection on Cormier and how, at 41, he\u2019s reached this point. One of the best anecdotes of this week came courtesy of The Athletic\u2019s Shaheen Al-Shatti, who got this gem from former Olympic gold medal wrestler Cael Sanderson, which highlights the kind of person DC is:\n\n\u201cFor him to put himself in a position where so many people have access to him, that says a lot about him, right? I remember before the 2004 Olympic Games, we were directly behind the basketball team. The (U.S.) men\u2019s basketball team. And because of the security at the time, it took several hours to get through security. We\u2019re waiting. And we were right behind them. And I remember Cormier, he went up and asked (an ultra-famous NBA player) for the his autograph. And (the ultra-famous NBA player) wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge him. Wouldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI just remember that image of Cormier. He asked this guy to sign something for him \u2013 and the guy wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge him. \u201cI just thought it was really disrespectful. But I just think it shows you what kind of a person Daniel is. Now Daniel is a guy that everyone in the gym wants his autograph \u2013 and he\u2019s still walking around freely. When he\u2019s talking to somebody, he\u2019s looking them in the eye. He\u2019s showing them the respect. Even though that\u2019s got to be exhausting for him and just a huge energy drain. Because, yeah, it\u2019s one thing to go in there and wrestle and coach kids. That\u2019s not the challenging and impressive part. It\u2019s the putting up with that celebrity that he has to deal with that.\u201d\n\nCormier never has forgotten this moment, and it seems to have played a role in how he would eventually deal with being famous. Cormier was asked about this memory during an interview with TSN\u2019s Aaron Bronstetter and gave an answer that sums up the class with which DC has always carried himself.\n\n\u201cIt was bad, right? It was a letdown,\u201d Cormier said of the autograph snub by the NBA star, whom he refused to name. \u201cI tried to make sure that, regardless of how I\u2019m feeling, I try to give people a little piece of me, make their experience to meeting me a pleasant one. Because you don\u2019t know what that does for a person, and you don\u2019t know who that person is going to eventually turn out to be.\n\n\u201cWhat if you meet the kid that\u2019s gonna become the President some day? You don\u2019t know. What if you meet a kid that\u2019s just having a bad day or an adult that\u2019s having a really bad day, and you\u2019re interaction can uplift them? You just never know what people are going through. So I just try to make sure that when people come in contact with me, the experience is pleasant.\u201d\n\nI wonder if that ultra-famous NBA player remembers the time he snubbed a future UFC champ-champ and what he thinks of it now.\n\nUFC 252 takes place Saturday at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.

But as he failed to capitalise on the chances due to his poor shot selection and questionable glovework.\n\nIt opened the doors for KL Rahul. The Karnataka batsman, on the contrary, latched on to the opportunity and made the most of it. Former India wicket-keepers Nayan Mongia, Deep Dasgupta and MSK Prasad agree that KL Rahul, on the basis of his past performances, should be preferred as the No.1 keeper for India in the limited-overs.\n\n\u201cKL, I think will be first choice in 50 overs. Whatever I have seen of KL, he hasn\u2019t been bad behind the stumps and also once he started keeping, his batting form improved in white ball cricket.\n\n\u201cOn form, KL will be my frst choice and after that you can look at Rishabh and give him chances,\u201d Mongia, one of India\u2019s finest wicket-keepers told PTI.\n\n\u201cLook, in T20s, I believe both can play in the XI. But given a choice, KL will be my man for the time at least in T20s.\n\n\u201cHowever in 50 over format, may be team management and selectors can speak to him and see he wants to do it long term till 2023 World Cup and bat at No. 5 which is a critical slot in the middle-order,\u201d Dasgupta, who has extensively covered Indian cricket in past few years as a broadcaster, said.\n\nKL Rahul was tried to bat at different positions for Team India and he delivered. His glovework was also neat which came as an added bonus for the wicket-keeper batsman. With the T20 World Cup at stake, it looks like Rahul has nearly sealed his spot as the first-choice wicket-keeper batsman ahead of Rishabh Pant.\n\nRahul will be next seen in action during the IPL 2020 in UAE. It will also be the first season as captain for KL Rahul. The India top-order batsman was promoted to the position after his phenomenal run for KXIP in the previous edition of IPL."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/sport\/football\/12350956\/watford-ismaila-sarr-40m-crystal-palace\/","domain":"thesun.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-08 20:30:00","title":"Watford will sell Ismaila Sarr for \u00a340m to ease financial pain of relegation with Crystal Palace keen on","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/SPORT-PREVIEW-Ismaila-Sarr-to-Crystal-Palace.jpg?w=620","content":"Sarr Subject Watford will sell Ismaila Sarr for \u00a340m to ease financial pain of relegation with Crystal Palace keen on transfer\n\nWATFORD will sell Ismaila Sarr for a stunning \u00a340million to ease the financial pain of relegation.\n\nThe Senegalese winger is being offered to several clubs at the huge fee to create an auction.\n\n1 Watford are willing to sell Ismaila Sarr for \u00a340million - with Crystal Palace interested Credit: Times Newspapers Ltd\n\nWe revealed last week that Crystal Palace want Sarr, 22, and they are now willing to buy him even without Wilfried Zaha leaving.\n\nVicarage Road chiefs have contacted Liverpool and Wolves about Sarr but neither are in a position to bid for him, despite liking the rapid attacker.\n\nPalace might win the race if the player wants to stay in the Premier League after an exciting but ultimately disappointing debut campaign.\n\nIf Watford do not drop the asking price, the Eagles are likely to have a go at signing Brentford\u2019s goalscoring wideman Said Benrahma, who they like the look of, along with fellow Bee Ollie Watkins.\n\nWatford will also try to sell Spanish forward Gerard Deulofeu, although the fee of \u00a315m and his \u00a385,000-a-week wages may limit the options.\n\nMeanwhile Palace are in talks with Ireland midfielder James McCarthy about a new contract.\n\nMcCarthy, 29, joined the Eagles a year ago and he is keen to extend his stay, with contract discussions beginning in earnest."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/pokerfuse.com\/features\/week-in-podcasts\/211609-week-poker-podcasts\/","domain":"pokerfuse.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 08:03:00","title":"This Week in Poker Podcasts","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/pokerfuse.com\/site_media\/media\/uploads\/news\/microphone_orig_full.jpg","content":"E044: NORMAN CHAD: This is the Worst WSOP of the Century!\n\nThis week on The Rake: We\u2019ve got the voice of poker himself, Norman Chad!

I\u2019m all for people having an opinion \u2013 unless it\u2019s O\u2019Hara on Rangers.\u201d\n\nMcCoist\u2019s former team-mate Graham Roberts weighed in and tweeted: \u201cBiggest clown on radio.\u201d\n\nRedknapp spent four years as a player at Bournemouth and five years in his first job in a distinguished managerial career.\n\nThe 72-year-old, who had O\u2019Hara as a player during his spell in charge of Tottenham, guided Bournemouth into the second tier for the first time in the club\u2019s history in 1987 where they were used to playing in front of crowds of up to 3000.\n\nClub legend Eddie Howe, who left when their five-year Premier League stay came to an end, lifted them to a new level in the top flight where the capacity is still only just over 11,000.\n\nRedknapp said: \u201cI love Ally McCoist to bits and he\u2019s dead right when he says Jamie must have been drinking when he came away with that statement.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, he can\u2019t have been serious and that\u2019s coming from someone who has a lot of affection for Bournemouth.\n\n\u201cBournemouth hadn\u2019t even been in the second tier for the first 88 years of their existence. They were a Division Three or Four team and I was the first man to get them into what is now the Championship and that was regarded as a miracle.\n\n\u201cEddie Howe then got them into the Premier League which is a miracle but when I was there we used to get 2000 and 3000 people so to say they\u2019re bigger than Glasgow Rangers, one of the biggest football clubs in the world\u2026\n\n\u201cI worked in America and Rangers came on tour and the place was mobbed. They had fans coming from Canada and all over to watch them. They\u2019re a massive club.\n\n\u201cHonestly, people don\u2019t realise how massive Rangers and Celtic are.

Ever since Ronald Koeman managed a bright young Ajax team featuring Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wesley Sneijder and so many others to within inches of the Champions League semifinal in 2003, the former Barcelona star has been in contention to return to the club whenever the manager\u2019s seat was open. Koeman was never shy about flirting back. He, too, envisioned a glorious return to complete his own soaring legacy in Catalonia.\n\nIt never quite happened. Most recently, back in January, Barcelona fired Ernesto Valverde for the crime of winning La Liga twice in a row and currently sitting in first place, the club\u2019s first midseason sacking since 2003. It was the flashpoint when a complicated season turned into an annus horribilis. Koeman reportedly turned down the job then. He preferred to remain with the Dutch national team through the planned Euro 2020, before that was delayed a year by the coronavirus pandemic. Even though the latter didn\u2019t pan out, it proved to be a wise move.\n\nUnder Quique Setien, Barcelona not only squandered the La Liga title to a rampant Real Madrid but was humiliated 8-2 by Bayern Munich in Friday\u2019s Champions League quarterfinal \u2014 the club\u2019s worst-ever European loss, sparking an instant crisis.\n\nSo now that Setien has been fired, or will be any minute, Koeman has been lined up to succeed him at last. Just a few months after promising to stay with the Dutch through the Euro, he will leave anyway, although the circumstances are mitigating, of course.\n\nKoeman is a perfectly defensible appointment, if not a particularly inspiring one. Koeman isn\u2019t the hot young manager anymore. He\u2019s a 57-year-old journeyman. One who has worked in Spain before, flaming out with Valencia in less than six months back in 2008. Lately, he\u2019s had a solid spell with Southampton in the Premier League, and then an underwhelming one with Everton. His Dutch national team looked strong in his two years in charge, but then it also had a gifted generation emerge. In ordinary times, this would have been business as usual.\n\nThe thing is, these aren\u2019t ordinary times.\n\nRonald Koeman? That's Barcelona's plan to fix everything ailing the club? (AP Photo\/Luis Vieira)\n\nThe same Monday morning that news of the Koeman appointment trickled out, the soccer world was grappling with a Sunday night report from a Brazilian outlet that superstar Lionel Messi wanted out of the club.\n\nMessi actually leaving would be cataclysmic. Then again, the man himself has remained typically mum and often says he\u2019d like to finish his career at the club he joined at 13, exactly 20 years ago. What\u2019s more, there are few viable options for him at his salary and buyout fee. There is an argument to be made that Messi\u2019s presence and insistence on competing stands in the way of the reboot the club needs. But his departure would be unforgivable to the fans, who also vote in the club\u2019s presidential elections. Woe upon the man who manages to lose Lionel Messi.\n\nThese two threads of narrative drama at Barca \u2014 because when is there ever not drama at Barca? \u2014 are connected. After its first completely trophy-less year since 2007-08, the situation calls for deep introspection at the club. A full accounting of all that has gone wrong needs to be taken, of the failed transfer policies, the irreversible aging of the squad, the erosion of the team\u2019s playing style, the lack of academy products in the first team. The whole lot needs to be reassessed.\n\nOnly then can the first team be retooled, or possible rebuilt, Messi permitting.\n\nBut quickly replacing one journeyman manager with another is the opposite of that. That\u2019s why Koeman\u2019s appointment, even though it was some 17 years in the making, rankles.\n\nBarcelona is not in the habit of hiring big-time managers. The last time it attracted an up-and-coming manager coveted by other big clubs was the first appointment of Louis van Gaal in 1997. Since then, the succession of managers has veered from the largely unproven to the out-of-their-depth. Ironically, only Valverde had walked a more traditional upward trajectory toward the Barca job, with stops at Athletic Bilbao, Espanyol, Villareal and Valencia.\n\nThe board reportedly didn\u2019t even really consider the out-of-work Mauricio Pochettino for the job because of his ties to local rival Espanyol and some old quotes about never working for Barca. Never mind that he\u2019s the rare kind of manager with the wherewithal to oversee the reconstruction the team needs.\n\nKoeman is a quick Band-Aid. Koeman is short-termism. Koeman is rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. A managerial change hardly satisfies when the problems run so much deeper. It won\u2019t satisfy Messi, certainly, which has practically been the club\u2019s raison d\u2019etre for the better part of a decade and perhaps too long.\n\nEvery executive at the club is under pressure. More heads are expected to roll. The call for the club\u2019s presidential elections to be held early, rather than next summer, swells by the day so that Josep Maria Bartomeu might face the gauntlet from the fans for the many failures during his five-year reign. Former president Joan Laporta will take another stab at returning and has spoken of bringing Pep Guardiola back as manager. Victor Font promises to install club legend Xavi.\n\nWhatever the outcome, it will mean more flux. Koeman\u2019s days at the club likely won\u2019t be long, certainly not as long as his six triumphant seasons playing there, when he scored an astounding 88 goals as a defender specializing in free kicks. The joke has been made on Dutch soccer Twitter that Koeman will be back with the national team before the Euro anyway.\n\nBarcelona has lost its way. Relying on a new manager to show it the way forward won\u2019t work. Nobody is fooled.\n\nLeander Schaerlaeckens is a Yahoo Sports soccer columnist and a sports communication lecturer at Marist College.

Lesser teams in the Premier League have done it, as we saw against Norwich in the past along with other teams, so Lyon can do it.\n\n\"Memphis Depay is now a real player and will love this scenario. He was too self-indulgent at United and that is how he sees himself. He is a star player, but at Lyon you see it a lot more than at United, and for that reason he is a dangerous prospect for the City defence.\n\n\"Moussa Dembele seems to be in and out of the team, so I cannot work that out. He was linked with Chelsea, and was bought for a fair value from Celtic.\n\n\"How will Lyon set up? You have to get hold of the ball and Lyon may only get 30 per cent in the game, but what will they do with it in that time?\n\n\"What we saw with City against Real Madrid was enough. Raheem Sterling's pace, Gabriel Jesus has got his confidence back with a nice finish, and Kevin De Bruyne is simply wonderful to watch.\n\n\"I was encouraged by the position Pep Guardiola played Phil Foden in against Real. The youngster will be ahead of Riyad Mahrez, but Pep could turn it and say this week you are not! That is the edge that he likes to keep them on.\n\n\"Foden on the wide left, Sterling and Jesus, with De Bruyne in behind may be how City shape up. The hard bit is getting to the final and winning it, but I can see City going past Lyon with ease in this one.\"\n\nMichael Owen - BetVictor - City win\n\n\"Manchester City are the only remaining English team in the tournament and their victory over 13 times champions, Real Madrid in the last round, was their best and most accomplished victory in a Champions League knockout tie.\n\n\"In a tournament that is all about peaking at the right time, the Sky Blues have never looked better although it is quite incredible that despite the huge sums that have been invested into the playing side of the Club over the last ten years, City have only reached the semi-finals on one previous occasion. That ended in defeat by Real Madrid back in 2015\/16 season.\n\n\"In this season\u2019s quarter final clash they face a Lyon side who survived a Cristiano Ronaldo inspired comeback in the Round of 16 to eventually progress on away goals. Lyon played Manchester City in the Group stages of least season\u2019s competition and earned a win and a draw across the two matches.\n\n\"City will need to be aware of the threat of Memphis Depay who has now scored in each of his last six Champions League appearances.\n\n\"However, Pep Guardiola knows from first-hand experience as both a player and a manager, just how difficult this competition is to win and their status as favourites is well deserved. City will never have a better chance to finally achieve the ultimate goal of their Abu Dhabi-based owners and I\u2019m predicting a 3-1 win for Manchester City in this one.\"\n\nSign up to our free MCFC email newsletter Man City are Premier League champions!

But it won\u2019t be business as usual. The T20 tournament was originally scheduled to begin on March 29. But the pandemic and consequent lockdown meant the season had to be postponed indefinitely.\n\nOn Sunday (August 2), the governing council of the league confirmed that this year\u2019s tournament will be held in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah from September 19 to November 10.\n\nDetailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are yet to be made public by the cricket board, but the broad guidelines set for the league and the internal protocols prepared by some teams provide a glimpse of what the season could look like.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHygiene: no touching or sharing equipment, masks at most times\n\nSeveral rules for players and officials mirror those in force in the football leagues across Europe, and in other sports such as basketball and Formula One that have restarted after the hiatus forced by the pandemic.\n\nAccording to an SOP prepared by one team, the players have been told to avoid using \u201chandshakes, high-fives, tackling, sparring etc\u201d as part of the training routine.\n\nIn a list of do\u2019s and don\u2019ts, the players have been asked to use their own personal equipment, like a towel or a water bottle, and to not share it with anybody.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe players have also been advised to dress for training before they leave their hotel rooms, instead of changing at the ground. In case they use the shower in the changing room post-practice, they will have to ensure their \u201csoaps, towels and other utilities are not shared\u201d.\n\nWearing a mask is compulsory at all times, except while training.\n\nA picture of the 2019 IPL trophy. (File Photo) A picture of the 2019 IPL trophy. (File Photo)\n\nSocial distancing: staggered training schedules, always 2 m apart\n\nThe training sessions, too, will look very different. The team\u2019s protocol says that the players will have to maintain \u201c2 m social distancing at all times and all places\u201d during practice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo make sure that happens, coaches have been advised to stagger training timings to minimise the number of players at nets at a given time. The equipment at the field of play will be handed to players and support staff only by the ground staff, who will wear \u201cadequate protective equipment like masks and gloves\u201d.\n\nAlso in Explained | How the UAE will save BCCI millions of dollars\n\nRole of the coach: close watch on the health of players\n\nThe coaches have been assigned the critical task of keeping a tab on the players\u2019 health. According to the team\u2019s SOP, one of the key responsibilities of the coach will be to ask his players \u201cif they are feeling ill before each training session and report all cases\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf a player shows any symptoms, or reports, of illness, he will be sent back to the hotel from the training ground. A special Covid-19 helpline will also be set up.\n\nThe other backroom staff, like the physiotherapist, have been given precise instructions. The physio, for instance, will have to make sure he does not touch the eyes, nose or mouth of a player while making sure there isn\u2019t more than one player in the room during treatment.\n\nA shower has been advised for players before each physiotherapy or massage session.\n\nThe team management is also likely to mark all face masks with a player\u2019s name to avoid interchanging.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe season will most likely be played without spectators. (File Photo) The season will most likely be played without spectators. (File Photo)\n\nAt the hotel: open doors, no touching doorknobs, AC at 24-30 degrees\n\nEach team is likely to stay at a different hotel in order to avoid coming in contact with others, while also ensuring discretion, given the strict protocols that have been set.\n\nThe players have been told not to socialise with their teammates and other staff before or after training. In common areas, like a meeting room, it has been advised that all doors and windows be kept open at all times.\n\nThe idea behind keeping the doors open in common areas is to avoid touching doorknobs. Windows will have to be kept open to provide natural ventilation. If at all an air-conditioner is used, it will have to be operated between \u201c24-30 degrees centigrade with humidity levels maintained between 40-70 per cent\u201d, according to a team\u2019s protocol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrength of the squad: One player will have to left behind\n\nA key decision for a lot of teams before they depart for the UAE will be to decide which player to leave out.\n\nThe franchises are allowed a maximum of 25 players in their squad, with the minimum number set at 18. But this season, the teams have been told to name not more than 24 players in their squad.\n\nThat means teams like Rajasthan Royals or Kings XI Punjab \u2013 who have 25 players on their roster \u2013 will have to make a big selection call even before they get on the plane to the Gulf.

The usual window for the IPL is 49 days. This season will instead last 53 days.\n\nOne of the reasons for this is the larger number of evening matches. The match timings have also been brought forward this year. While the norm previously was 4.30 pm start for afternoon matches and 8 pm for evening games, the 10 afternoon ties this season will start an hour earlier at 3.30 pm, while night games will begin at 7.30 pm.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the fewer afternoon matches are because of the weather conditions in the Gulf, the earlier start times have been decided keeping in mind the broadcasters\u2019 interest.\n\nThe BCCI had an 8 pm start to boost its ticket sales. However, with the matches now being held in the UAE, the timings have been advanced by half an hour for the broadcasters to make the most of the evening prime time.\n\nSpectators on the ground: Stands will likely by kept empty\n\nWhile the season will most likely be played without spectators, the Emirates Cricket Board has said it is exploring the option of filling the stands by up to 30-50 per cent.\n\nThe UAE has around 6,000 active cases at the moment, and the ECB secretary Mubashshir Usmani has said they are hopeful of allowing some fans into the stadium.\n\n\u201cWe will definitely want our people to experience this prestigious event but it is totally the government\u2019s decision.

Pakistan were 223-9 when bad light -- despite the Ageas Bowl floodlights being on full beam -- led to an early close of the second day.Rizwan was 60 not out after more than three hours at the crease.

Excellent batting from the right-hander.Rain and Fawad Alam made the most news on the opening day (Thursday), when the latter's return to Test stage after a long wait ended with a duck, while the rain allowed only 45.4 overs to be bowled.England great James Anderson returned to form with two wickets, after Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat, that left the visitors wobbling at 126\/5 at stumps as a combination of rain and bad light cut short play on the first day.Anderson had taken 2-35 from 15 overs to move to within eight wickets of becoming the first paceman with 600 in Tests.All of England's four quicks enjoyed success, with only Pakistan opener Abid Ali -- dropped twice in the slips -- offering prolonged resistance during an innings of 60.It was not long before England's all-time leading wicket-taker struck after Pakistan captain Azhar Ali chose to bat.In humid conditions conducive to Anderson's bowling, he needed just eight balls to have Shan Masood, fresh from his Test-best 156, lbw for one with an in-swinger to the left-hander.Then, Azhar, on 20, edged a full-length Anderson delivery and Burns held a good, low catch to leave Pakistan 78\/2.Abid completed a 99-ball fifty featuring six fours after tea.But left-arm seamer Sam Curran, recalled in place of fast bowler Jofra Archer, had Abid taken in the slips by Burns with a ball that angled across the right-hander following a couple of inswingers.Sibley, to his evident relief, held a slip catch off Broad as Asad Shafiq fell cheaply.Alam, a prolific run-scorer in Pakistan domestic cricket, played the last of his three previous Tests, in which he averages over 41, against New Zealand in Dunedin in November 2009. The 34-year-old was the only change to the side after replacing leg-spinning all-rounder Shadab Khan.But Alam lasted just five minutes at the crease. Batting with an extremely open stance, Alam was lbw for a four-ball naught to in-form all-rounder Woakes.Alam was initially given not out but an England review revealed the ball had pitched in line, with a squared-up Alam in front of his stumps.England, as well as recalling Curran, made an expected change when batsman Zak Crawley returned in place of Ben Stokes.Star all-rounder Stokes is missing the final two matches of this series for personal reasons after travelling to New Zealand to be with his ill father."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/www.pgatour.com\/news\/2020\/08\/09\/tiger-woods-finishes-strong-ahead-of-fedexcup-playoffs-push-pga-championship-tpc-harding-park.html","domain":"pgatour.com","published_date":"2020-08-09 20:11:15","title":"Tiger finishes strong at PGA ahead of FedExCup Playoffs push","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/pgatour-prod\/w_854,h_480,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto\/pgatour\/news\/editorial\/2020\/08\/09\/woods-847-jamiesquire.jpg","content":"\u201cWhat I got out of this week is that I felt I was competitive,\u201d Woods said. \u201cIf I would have made a few more putts on Friday early on, and the same thing with Saturday, I felt like I would have been right there with a chance.

Wilson threw away a 53-point lead in the first frame of the session and then gifted the second to O'Sullivan too after missing an easy black.\n\nBut the Warrior finally came to life to kick off a remarkable comeback. He pulled one frame back with a run of 92 before reducing the deficit to four once more after winning another marathon frame littered with errors.\n\nWilson made it three in a row after the break, playing by far the better snooker as a lacklustre O'Sullivan struggled to stay at the table for more than a minute. A run of 58 then helped the underdog to go within two.\n\nNow just 8-6 up, O'Sullivan finally found some form to take a closely-fought frame and bring Wilson's run of four consecutive frames to an end.\n\nUnfazed, Wilson responded with a fantastic century, but O'Sullivan took the last frame of the session after Wilson missed a crucial, frame-ball red.\n\nKyren Wilson knocks in vital century against Ronnie O'Sullivan\n\nAfter falling six behind, Wilson will be delighted to remain within touching distance heading into the final day.\n\nWhat drama! Kyren Wilson misses crucial red and Ronnie O'Sullivan cleans up\n\nFirst session report\n\nFive-time champion O'Sullivan took a quick first frame but Wilson showed guts to level despite falling 44 behind, grinding his way through a tough second frame to get on the scoreboard.\n\nBut the underdog slipped in the third to let O'Sullivan in, who made no mistake to make it 2-1 before doubling that lead with a break of 75 before the mid-session interval.\n\nRonnie O'Sullivan lands outrageous fluke in final\n\nNeither player was anywhere near their best as the afternoon session continued as they struggled o build big breaks while making a series of elementary errors.\n\nThe Rocket then fluffed an easy safety to let Wilson pull one back for 3-2 with a break of 63, but the low standard of play suited the Rocket who was able to steal frames whenever Wilson made mistakes at the table.\n\nHe regained a two-frame lead in the sixth after Wilson missed an easy red, and then hit the first century of the match to go 5-2 up.\n\nRonnie O'Sullivan with brilliant century - 'the crowd are loving every moment of this'\n\nO'Sullivan then made a litany of errors in a marathon eighth frame and was visibly shocked at his own performance, but nerves got the better of Wilson who failed to capitalise and the Rocket took the scrappiest of frames to make it 6-2 ahead of the evening session.\n\nTHE BREAK PODCAST\n\nRonnie O'Sullivan may have a three frame lead over Kyren Wilson going into the last day of the World Snooker Championship final, but as ex player Neal Foulds and commentator Philip Studd discuss with Rachel Casey, this is a very unpredictable year and an extraordinary Championship; anything could happen.\n\nThe trio have a comprehensive review of the first two sessions of the final and look ahead to the next two."},{"topic":"SPORTS","link":"https:\/\/wwos.nine.com.au\/nrl\/phil-gould-wouldnt-blame-brisbane-broncos-coach-anthony-seibold-for-walking-away\/c7c4c053-2ca4-4987-b84e-9d8b2b0b65cc","domain":"wwos.nine.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-13 23:28:13","title":"Phil Gould's blunt advice for under-fire Brisbane coach Anthony Seibold","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.ffx.io\/images\/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_1%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_821%2C$x_14%2C$y_0\/t_crop_custom\/c_scale%2Cw_620%2Cq_88%2Cf_auto\/fd074fcbf9d94abecd2ef9d26186ee3aaba9aee3","content":"Premiership winning coach Phil Gould says he wouldn't blame Brisbane mentor Anthony Seibold if he walked away from the club, amid constant speculation over his future.\n\nThe Broncos have lurched from one crisis to the next this year, and could pick up the club's first ever wooden spoon.

As much as this is a sport, and we're all incredibly competitive against each other and [you] use everything within your armoury to beat your rivals, nobody every really wants this situation.\n\n\"But Williams has always been very clear on what we feel to be the real and true DNA of this sport, the traditional DNA.\n\n\"Some would argue that, well, that is traditional, that is history, and in order to be successful you need to adapt, innovate and change, and that's what teams like Racing Point have done.\n\n\"But we will always stand by the philosophy that Formula 1 teams, constructors, should absolutely be designing and manufacturing the performance-related parts on their cars.\n\n\"Obviously this is the question, the debate, that's going on around Racing Point at the moment with their rear brake ducts.\n\n\"I don't want to go into a whole lot of commentary about it, I don't think that it's right.\n\n\"We have submitted our intent to protest with the FIA, and it's up to the FIA. It's their jurisdiction in order to analyse what's happened and in order to attribute punishment if that's appropriate or penalties if that's appropriate, if [Racing Points is] found in breach of regulations.\"\n\nDespite Renault's successful protest of the Racing Point brake ducts, the FIA also ruled that it would be unrealistic to expect the team to \"unlearn\" what it now knows and re-engineer the parts.\n\nTherefore, as it stands, the brake ducts can stay on the car without incurring any more penalties, although the team is set to be issued with a reprimand after each race.\n\nThat, says Williams, is something that should be addressed in the appeal.\n\n\"I think it's quite confusing for fans that we've got a sporting regulation that's in breach but not a technical [regulation], and therefore these brake ducts can continue to be put into use,\" she added.\n\n\"But they are performance-related parts. So it's something that we very much hope and we know [the FIA] will be looking into, and they will be making the right decision moving forward.\""},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.kotaku.com.au\/2020\/08\/how-to-survive-fall-guys-toughest-mini-games\/","domain":"kotaku.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-05 19:00:00","title":"How To Survive Fall Guys\u2019 Toughest Mini-Games","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.kinja-img.com\/image\/upload\/c_fill,h_542,q_60,w_965\/82ea2f470aeb9b39d91037cd2f8896f3.jpg","content":"All The Saw Movies, Ranked From Worst To Best\n\nIt\u2019s been 20 years since we first played a game with Jigsaw, so we ranked all the horror franchise\u2019s films"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.prweb.com\/releases\/3_legged_thing_announces_two_new_tripods_in_the_legends_range\/prweb17290850.htm","domain":"prweb.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 07:01:53","title":"3 Legged Thing Announces Two New Tripods in the Legends Range","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/ww1.prweb.com\/prfiles\/2020\/07\/30\/17290850\/BuckyKitGrey-4.jpg","content":"In both Ray, and the larger version, Bucky, we have achieved incredible functionality and capability, without compromising on the core requirements Post this\n\n\"I've been looking forward to this launch for over a year. The Ray Barbee tribute tripod is a ground-breaking upgrade in travel support systems, and homage to one of the most influential skateboarders ever to have graced the sport,\" said Danny Lenihan, Founder and CEO of 3 Legged Thing. \"As a boy, I remember seeing Ray burst onto the skateboarding scene in the iconic Powell-Peralta Bones Brigade video, Public Domain, followed by his incredible section in the follow up, Ban This.\"\n\n\"I really wanted to make something that Ray, also a Leica ambassador, could use all the time, without feeling like he was carrying something cumbersome, whilst retaining all of the load and structural capabilities of our award-winning Leo tripod. In both Ray, and the larger version, Bucky, we have achieved incredible functionality and capability, without compromising on the core requirements, and have trimmed off a huge 20% in weight. We have partnered the tripod with the world's first, visible mechanism ball-head \u2013 the AirHed Vu - another landmark innovation from 3 Legged Thing, and another reason for me to be so very proud of the work of my fantastic team in Stagsden.\"\n\nRay Barbee commented: \"I think it's great how Danny incorporates the things that inspire him in themes for his products. I am super humbled and honoured that Danny has chosen to name a tripod for me. The brand is making a lot of cool stuff and I'm excited to be a part of it.\"\n\nRay is 3LT's newest ultra-compact, micro traveller. With a folded length of 35.6 cm \/ 14.02 \", he is the perfect companion for any trip photographers may take. Although he is small enough to fit into hand luggage, he still can take a max load of 30 kg \/ 66 lbs, making him a powerful tool for all photographers.\n\nBucky stands tall above the rest boasting a maximum height of 1.89 m \/ 74.48 \" and a minimum height of 11cm \/ 4.33\", just above ground level, giving him an impressive working range. The triple section centre column enables him to stand out, making Bucky even more versatile. With this, photographers gain greater freedom with what they can create without compromising on quality or stability.\n\nBoth tripods are constructed from 8 layers of 100% pure Japanese carbon fibre, and aerospace-grade, anodised magnesium alloy, providing incredible strength, rigidity, and durability. They feature 3 detachable legs to enable conversion to a table-top tripod with the help of 3LT's Vanz tripod footwear. The legs can be used as boom arms for microphones or lights, or joined to the centre column to create a monopod.\n\nThe new style twist locks with O-Pads give users improved, grip, leverage and water displacement. Internally Ray and Bucky's locks feature a new style of Chicken Lips (shims) that give improved strength and create an unprecedented level of stability. 3LT's Rapid Latch makes adjusting the leg angles easier for those with impairments or wearing thick gloves.\n\nThese two tripods also offer impressive load to weight ratios as some weight reductions were made to the locks and canopy without compromising on strength and stability. Along with these features, both tripods have two new additions \u2013 a new AirHed and a new design of 3LT's patented Tri-mount plate.\n\nThe AirHed Vu has been designed and engineered for strength. It features contoured security cut-outs in the detachable clamp to accommodate security pins in the underside of the new QR Octa quick release plate that is supplied with the head. These cut-outs have the added benefit of reducing weight. The AirHed Vu has a vision panel in the casing which allows users to see the mechanism move into place. The controls feature knurling on all knobs on the AirHed to improve grip and leverage and to enable users to secure their cameras in place.\n\n3 Legged Thing's patented Tri-mount plate, which allows for the attachment of accessories and includes 6 \u00bc\"-20 screw threads, has been refined from previous versions seen in the Pro and Punks ranges, and is now elegantly contoured for ease of use when removing and mounting onto the canopy for low level shooting.\n\nThe other little extra 3LT have released is their Vanz tripod footwear. These are a hybrid of Stilettoz and Bootz, offering the best of both worlds. These allow users to turn 3LT's Legends and Pro Range 2.0 tripods into a table-top system by unscrewing the legs and replacing them with Vanz. Users without detachable legs can still use Vanz if the tripod has 3\/8\"-16 or \u00bc\"-20 threads on the feet, and can be used as a way to elevate the tripod away from rocky or mucky surfaces.\n\nRay, Bucky and the AirHed Vu are available for pre-order starting today from retailers worldwide or direct from 3LeggedThing.com.\n\nRay\n\nRAY, legs only, SRP - \u00a3319.99 \/ US $329.99\n\nRAYKIT, including AirHed Vu, SRP - \u00a3389.99 \/ US $429.99\n\nBucky\n\nBUCKY, legs only, SRP - \u00a3379.99 \/ US $399.99\n\nBUCKYKIT, including AirHed Vu, SRP - \u00a3449.99 \/ US $499.99\n\nAirHed Vu\n\nAIRHED VU, complete with QR-Octa, SRP - \u00a3149.99 \/ US $169.99\n\nFor more information on the Legends range click here:\n\nRay web page\n\nBucky web page\n\nHeadquartered in two converted chicken sheds (Shedquarters & Return of the Shedi) on Kinsbourne Farm, in Stagsden, England, 3 Legged Thing is a small, British company of passionate people, creating and innovating camera support systems for photographers and videographers. 3 Legged Thing was the winner of the Lucie Technical Awards 2017 Tripod of the Year, and 2018 nominee for best tripod and best industrial design.\n\nIf you would like more information about this press release, please contact Alison Barclay or Megan Prouse on +44 (0) 1234 828834 or email marketing(at)3leggedthing(dot)com.\n\nSOURCE 3 LEGGED THING LIMITED\n\nRelated Links\n\nhttp:\/\/www.3LeggedThing.com\n\n"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/in.mashable.com\/tech\/16269\/google-delays-phase-out-timeline-for-chrome-apps-on-all-platforms","domain":"in.mashable.com","published_date":"2020-08-11 08:14:00","title":"Google Delays Phase-Out Timeline For Chrome Apps On All Platforms","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/sm.mashable.com\/t\/mashable_in\/news\/g\/google-wil\/google-will-phase-out-cookies-in-chrome-just-not-anytime-soo_bq2m.1248.jpg","content":"> Tech\n\nGoogle has published an updated timeline for killing off support for Chrome apps in the coming years.\n\nThe plans build on the initial announcement in January this year when Google firmly said that it would be ending support for Chrome apps by the end of 2020.

The aim was to release a polished version of the ancient single-player mode in time for the game's 25th anniversary in 2022.\n\nIt seemed like a lot of work but, a year later, GoldenEye 25 creator Ben Colcough seemed to be making good progress. Now, two years in, the project should have been halfway to the finish line.\n\nStep up 2020. Last night, the game's Twitter account posted to say it had been \"kindly asked by the IP holder (MGM\/Danjaq) to cease development of GoldenEye 25.\n\n\"This was always in the back of our heads as a possibility but we've tried our best to keep going. Of course we will comply and want to thank you for your ongoing support.\n\n\"We cannot do a Bond game but we can still do a great game with all the beloved aspects of our favourite 90's action shooter. If you are still interested in following us, please come over to @projectianus where we will share development of our new game.\n\n\"This account will be deleted by Friday at the latest.\"\n\nSo, GoldenEye 25 is dead, but the project lives on. Writing on the new Project Ianus account, Colcough confirmed development will continue on this \"original game\" without using the names or likenesses of James Bond characters.\n\nOn the upside, stripping the game of its Bond references means the project can now release on Steam, as well as potentially on consoles.\n\nNo doubt you're wondering what's happened. We're not allowed to continue using the name GoldenEye or the James Bond characters. We'll take what we've made and create an original game.

One of the best toys of the 20th century, the Super Soaker.\n\nAnd it came to existence all thanks to an accidental discovery.\n\nIt was all thanks to an accident\n\n\u201cWhen I came up for the idea for the water gun, I was working on something else,\u201d Johnson recalls. \u201cI was working on a new idea for a heat pump that would use water as a working fluid instead of Freon.\u201d At the time, there was concern about how the continuous use of Freon would impact the environment, so Johnson set out to see if he could develop a refrigeration system that used water, instead.\n\n\u201cI was experimenting with some nozzles that I machined, and I shot a stream of water across the bathroom and I thought, \u2018Geez, maybe I should put this hard science stuff aside and work on something fun like a water gun. Maybe I could get enough money to support my habit,\u201d Johnson recalls.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the engineer\u2019s first foray into toy-making. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I always wanted to make a better toy, something I enjoyed playing with,\u201d he remembers.\n\nHe had been making toys since he was a kid\n\nOne of his earliest toy creations was building chinaberry guns with his friends using a mop and hollowed out bamboo tubing. This would foreshadow a later (very popular) invention.\n\n\u201cThat was actually the first Nerf gun, before Nerf came out,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cI was using compressed air to shoot chinaberries.\u201d\n\nOh, did we mention that he also invented the Nerf gun?\n\n\u201cSome of my most famous patents are for the Nerf guns and Super Soakers,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cFor the N-Strike Nerf product line, those guns were all based on my patents \u2026 Super Soaker, of course, that entire line started as a result of my invention.\u201d\n\nJohnson considers himself a lifelong tinkerer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been an inventor, I think, for all my life,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cEver since I was a small kid, I used to tinker and make little toys and things \u2026 I built a go-cart, windmills, just a lot, rockets.\u201d\n\nHe grew up in Alabama in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement\n\nOne of his proudest inventions to date is a robot he built in high school. Johnson attended the all-Black Williamson High School in Mobile, Alabama, and presented his robot \u2013 named \u201cLinex\u201d \u2013 at a local Junior Engineering science fair held at the University of Alabama. His team represented the only Black school at the fair. The year was 1968, only five years after a federal district court ordered the University of Alabama to admit Black students Vivian Malone and James Hood. Governor George Wallace, who earlier that year had declared, \u201cSegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,\u201d stood in the doorway of Foster Auditorium, causing a showdown with federal authorities.\n\n\u201cWhen I grew up in Alabama back then, everything was still very segregated,\u201d Johnson recalls. \u201cThe people that I interacted with on a daily basis were primarily Black, my teachers were all Black, so racism and being treated unfairly was never a part of my daily activity or consideration.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, when we went to the University of Alabama, that was a totally different environment, everyone there was White except for us, and the fact that I was there with my robot to me was a victory in itself.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the only victory he would walk away with that day \u2013 Johnson, and Linex, were awarded first place.\n\nLonnie Johnson, inventor of Super Soaker a large plastic pump-action water gun, holding his invention & its US patent while sitting on grass outside his home.

England\/The LIFE Images Collection\/Getty Images\n\nHe attended Tuskegee University on a scholarship\n\nAfter high school, Johnson attended Tuskegee University, graduating with a bachelor\u2019s in mechanical engineering and a master\u2019s in nuclear engineering. One of his first jobs after school was at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, working on cooling systems for nuclear reactors.\n\n\u201cI was working alongside a guy who had the same level of engineering I had, he had a master\u2019s degree and he had graduated from Penn State and he was White, of course,\u201d Johnson remembers. \u201cAnd, it turns out, I was doing a better job than he was. Since then, I\u2019ve always felt very good about my education at Tuskegee.\u201d\n\nJohnson went on to join the Air Force, which would eventually lead him to his time at NASA.\n\nHe worked on the Galileo spacecraft that was sent to Jupiter\n\n\u201cAfter I had done some analysis for the Air Force, I predicted some things that NASA had gone on record to say could not happen,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cI proved NASA\u2019s prediction to be not totally accurate, that\u2019s when I got offered the job at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, and there I went to work on the Galileo spacecraft as a power systems engineer.\u201d\n\nDuring his time at NASA, he developed a pivotal power supply mechanism for the Galileo spacecraft that was deployed to study Jupiter and its moons.\n\n\u201cIt was an invention that my fellow engineers said would not work,\u201d Johnson remembers. \u201cI got that working, got that on the spacecraft, and many of them came up to me to apologize for the things they were saying about my idea \u2026 That to me was a major moral victory, to think, I\u2019ve arrived, now I\u2019m a real engineer.\u201d\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This NASA genius invented the Super Soaker 02:30 - Source: Great Big Story\n\nHe spent days working on the Stealth Bomber, and nights on the Super Soaker\n\nIt was also around that time that he got the initial idea for the Super Soaker. Johnson left NASA to go back to active duty with the Air Force, all the while tinkering with water gun prototypes.\n\n\u201cThat was when I was working on the water gun in my basement after work in the evenings,\u201d Johnson remembers. \u201cThen, I left there and went out to Edwards Air Force Base, worked on the Stealth Bomber program back when it was highly classified, and nobody knew that it existed. I actually couldn\u2019t tell my wife what I was working on in the daytime, it was that top secret.\u201d\n\nWhile Johnson\u2019s creative and technical genius may strike at any time, there is a lot that goes into taking a spark of discovery and turning it into something that is ready for the world.\n\n\u201cFrom the time I got the idea for the Super Soaker, it took about seven years before I found a path to get it commercialized,\u201d Johnson recalls. \u201cThen, it was about 10 years from the time I got the idea to the time it became the No. 1 selling toy in the world. It\u2019s a story of perseverance.\u201d\n\nThere were a few Super Soaker prototypes that were never sold\n\nSo, were there any Super Soaker ideas that didn\u2019t make it?\n\n\u201cI developed a system where after you\u2019ve finished shooting the gun, you could just stick it into a pool of water or a bucket and press a button and it would automatically suck the water in and you\u2019re good to go again,\u201d Johnson remembers. \u201cIt was a quick refill, self-refilling water gun. That one really never made it to the market.\u201d\n\nToday, Johnson is working to encourage students to pursue their interests in STEM. He has partnered with 100 Black Men of Atlanta and FIRST Robotics to introduce more students to engineering and technology.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I really relate to is people saw my interest in engineering very early and they nurtured that, they cultivated that,\u201d Johnson remembers. \u201cI think the earlier we can get kids interested and the more we can give positive feedback as opposed to criticism, the more likely we are to see kids grow up to be successful, I believe very strongly in that.\u201d\n\nHe is also continuing to tinker with new inventions with his team at Johnson Battery Technologies.\n\nDr. Johnson holds a prototype for the Super Soaker. Great Big Story\n\nToday, he is working on a project with NASA\n\n\u201cInventing is what I do,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nHe is currently working with NASA on a heat-to-electric energy convertor, as well as working on a lithium-air battery, which, if successful, Johnson believes could have the capacity to hold 10 times the energy of a lithium ion battery.\n\nStill, he knows that people will forever remember him for his contributions to their childhood.\n\n\u201cI find it curious that people seem to make a big fuss about me and the Super Soaker and I\u2019m still trying to get used to that,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cI come to work, I try to invent and develop new things to solve problems. There\u2019s an expression that says, \u2018Need is the mother of invention,\u2019 so I look for really good problems to solve. That\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nHear Dr. Lonnie Johnson\u2019s tell his story in the latest episode of Great Big Story, a new podcast from CNN about the surprising stories all around us."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/citizen.co.za\/motoring\/motoring-news-motoring\/2340262\/volkswagen-says-goodbye-to-short-lived-v8-tdi-with-touareg-last-edition\/","domain":"citizen.co.za","published_date":"2020-08-12 16:00:00","title":"Volkswagen says goodbye to short-lived V8 TDI with Touareg Last Edition","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/media.citizen.co.za\/assets\/img\/citizen.png","content":"Volkswagen says goodbye to short-lived V8 TDI with Touareg Last Edition\n\nOutputs from the 4.0 twin-turbodiesel V8 will remain unchanged at 310kW\/900Nm.\n\nWith BMW ending production quad-turbodiesel straight-six engine last month, Volkswagen has now bid farewell to its V8 oil-burner in the Touareg after just over a year in production.\n\nAlthough apparently set to continue in the Audi SQ7 and SQ8, the twin-turbo 4.0-litre bent-eight\u2019s future became sealed last year after Volkswagen Group Head of Passenger Vehicle Sales and Marketing, J\u00fcrgen Stackmann, confirmed to Top Gear Magazine that the 310kW\/900Nm unit would be Wolfsburg\u2019s last ever large displacement diesel engine.\n\nBefore becoming available Touareg, it had already been discontinued in the Bentley Bentayga Diesel due to poorer than expected sales. According to Germany\u2019s Auto Motor und Sport, the V8 only accounted for 17% of diesel Touareg sales in its home market, with 77% of buyers wanting an oil-burner opting for the smaller 3.0 TDI V6. Its place as flagship Touareg will now be taken by the plug-in hybrid Touareg R.\n\n\u201cWe had a long debate, and we believe Touareg is a prime car. It can handle any competitor from around the world. Giving it a V8 twist is a very special honour, and I believe it\u2019s going to be a collector\u2019s car, from day one,\u201d Stackmann told the British publication at the time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met a lot of Touareg V10 TDI customers, and those that have one will never sell it. It\u2019ll be the same idea with the V8. It\u2019s for those customers who want something very special, and they\u2019ll get it. Most likely, it\u2019ll be the last V8 diesel car you\u2019ll see\u201d.\n\nShown for the first time at last year\u2019s Geneva Motor Show, the engine, which won\u2019t be adapted to comply with Euro 7 emissions regulations, will remain unchanged for the Touareg Last Edition that will be sold only in Germany where production will total 400 units.\n\nGoing on sale next week Monday (17 August), the Last Edition uses the Touareg R-Line as a base, but receives unique touches, namely gloss black wheel arch cladding, a gloss black finish on the diffuser and door handles as part of the Black Style Pack, Last Edition badging on the B-pillars and a options pack that includes black 21-inch Suzuka alloy wheels, the Matrix LED headlights, adaptive chassis and the Innovision Cockpit.\n\nAble to accelerate from 0-100 km\/h in 4.9 seconds and on to a limited top speed of 250 km\/h, the Touareg V8 TDI Last Edition will have a choice of six colours; Pure White, Silicon Grey Metallic, Antimony Silver Metallic, Malbec Red Metallic, Oryx White Metallic Pearl Effect and Deep Black Pearl Effect and come with a sticker price of \u20ac104 361 (R2 1418 47) versus the R-Line\u2019s \u20ac92 201 (R1 892 282).\n\nFor more news your way, download The Citizen\u2019s app for iOS and Android."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/misfits-280-android-wear-smartwatches-are-on-sale-for-40\/","domain":"cnet.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 19:34:00","title":"Misfit's $280 Android Wear smartwatches are on sale for $40","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/a\/img\/resize\/c85210b4ad96f39db56e541be2c831c50f8092e3\/hub\/2019\/10\/17\/b1224032-3903-46b6-b44e-a1021639ce8b\/misfit-vapor-x-promo.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200","content":"Welcome to the Island of Misfit Deals.

There is also a new $8 DLC pack that is, purportedly, just a hat. You will not be shocked to learn that it is more than just a hat.\n\n\n\nLive Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum' Share Live Forever in the Universe of New World: Aeternum\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who\u2019ve somehow avoided the internet\u2019s most pervasive game turned meme turned urban legend, Frog Fractions initially presents itself as a cutesy \u201890s-style edutainment game starring a frog who slurps up bugs until fractions come out. If you stick with it long enough, however, it blossoms into an absurdist pastiche of every game genre under the sun, from text adventures to Dance Dance Revolution. It culminates in the frog becoming President, to give you an idea how much it escalates within its relatively brief runtime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2014, creator Jim Crawford Kickstarted a sequel, but with a twist: When the game came out, he said, it would not be called Frog Fractions 2. One-upping its predecessor, it would emerge from a different game entirely, like a surprise planned just for you bursting out of a giant cake at somebody else\u2019s birthday party . This gave rise to a question that trailed every weird or unexpected game release of the following two years: \u201cIs this Frog Fractions 2?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the tail end of 2016, after an expansive alternate reality game that spanned multiple other other games, fans finally found Frog Fractions 2 in a fairy-themed management game called Glittermitten Grove. The sequel, a dungeon-crawler with more elaborate systems than the first, was well-received, but it didn\u2019t catch on like its more accessible predecessor. Plus, that was it: The internet had solved the mystery. The journey, it seems, ended up being more important than the destination. After that, Frog Fractions mania died down.\n\nFour years later, it turns out that the Frog Fractions saga is not over. The Game of the Decade edition\u2019s DLC Hop\u2019s Iconic Cap begins like a standard run of the original Frog Fractions, except the frog is wearing a hat. But if you stick with it up to the point where things usually get wacky, they now get wacky in a different way.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe camera pulls back to reveal that everything you, as the frog, have been doing is happening in a theater, and you\u2019re being heckled by the only person in the audience: a faux-pro-consumer YouTuber named Content-Aware Phil. The two of you get into an argument, and your boss sends you home to your wife, a cat named Hatricia Hop-Meow, your daughter October, and a secret service agent named Ralph. You, after all, were impeached, so now you\u2019re living a normal life while reenacting the glories of your heyday\u2014a pretty sad fate, all things considered. Hatricia suggests you seek out a new adventure, and so you, with October in tow, do exactly that. The two of you go to a museum dedicated to your glory days. Before long, things spin characteristically out of control, and you end up on an actual new adventure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe initial segment largely plays out as a literal point-and-click adventure, but before long, you find yourself sucked into another genre-hopping journey, this one touching on JRPGs, cult classic shoot-\u2018em-up Ikaruga, word scrambles, Dig Dug, and more Dig Dug. I won\u2019t spoil any more of it because you should really just go play it, but suffice it to say, it\u2019s much more reminiscent of Frog Fractions 1 than Frog Fractions 2.\n\nOr at least, I would say that, if Frog Fractions 2 was really Frog Fractions 2. After I completed Hop\u2019s Iconic Cap, I asked creator Jim Crawford if it was Frog Fractions 3.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn my headcanon, this is Frog Fractions 4 and 5,\u201d he told Kotaku in a DM.\n\nFrog Fractions 3, then, is the friends we made along the way. OK, he did not actually say that. Instead, it\u2019s really quite simple: Frog Fractions 2 is Frog Fractions 3.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn my headcanon, Frog Fractions 2 was the Kickstarter\/ARG, and Frog Fractions 3 was Glittermitten Grove,\u201d said Crawford.\n\nSo, for all those years, when people were asking \u201cIs this Frog Fractions 2?\u201d they were, through the simple act of asking that question, playing Frog Fractions 2. And now they can play Frog Fractions 4 and 5, which may or may not also be Frog Fractions 6-12\/37\u2014who can really say anymore? Anything is possible as long as you\u2019re willing to break out of your old habits and take a running leap into the deep end every once in a while.

Unlike Android tablets, the apps available on the App Store for Apple iPads include better-optimized apps. The refreshed UI for the Android tablets comes almost 10 months after it was introduced on Apple iPads.\n\nSpotify finally revamps the app UI on Android tablets\n\nThe left bar on the app now includes the menu featuring home, search, and your library, along with the now playing information.

With the larger screen size and form factor, the tablet version should have the best of both worlds. As of now, there is no official announcement from the company.\n\nWith Spotify getting into video podcasts, this new update is evident. As per the source, the refresh UI was found on the v8.5.72.625 for the Android tablets and v8.5.72.287 on Chromebooks. Additionally, this rollout could have been a server-side update. If not, try updating the Spotify app to the latest version through Play Store.\n\nRecently, Spotify all made changes to the newly introduced \u201cGroup Session\u201d mode. It now allows its users to listen to the same song or podcast together at the same time from anywhere in the world. For now, this feature is only limited to its paying customers.\n\nThe Spotify app for Android now comes with a new Bedtime feature for listening to sleep playlists while going to bed. Instead of opening the Spotify app, the users can set the bedtime feature from the default Clock app."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/17\/apple-expanding-60-day-applecare-purchase-window-to-full-year-for-hardware\/","domain":"9to5mac.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 19:31:00","title":"Apple expanding 60-day AppleCare purchase window to full year for hardware","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/wp-content\/client-mu-plugins\/9to5-core\/includes\/obfuscate-images\/images\/9to5mac-default.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1600","content":"Apple is significantly extending the amount of time customers have to add AppleCare coverage to protect their iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and other hardware products.

This extension from a 60-day window to a one-year window should make it significantly easier for customers to buy AppleCare+ coverage after their initial purchase.\n\nInterestingly, Apple says that the offer is available to customers who buy AppleCare+ in full or who pay via installments using Apple Card. Those who pay via other monthly payments will not be eligible.\n\n\u201cThis gives customers another opportunity to protect their device and have access to all the AppleCare+ benefits,\u201d Apple wrote in a memo to staff seen by Bloomberg News. The company told employees the offer is available to customers who pay for AppleCare+ in full versus monthly payments, or for those that subscribe via installments on the Apple Card credit card.\n\nEven with this expansion, keep in mind that your iPhone or other product will need to be in normal working condition and not damaged to add AppleCare. AppleCare+ for iPhone includes up to two incidents of accidental damage coverage every 24 months.\n\nAppleCare+ with Theft and Loss includes up to two incidents of accidental damage, theft, or loss coverage every 24 months. Both tiers of AppleCare+ serve as a complement to the one-year limited warranty that comes with Apple hardware purchases.\n\nYou can learn more about AppleCare+ on Apple\u2019s website here.

It wouldn't be much fun sharing shots of tequila with someone who physically cannot get drunk because they lack the sufficient organs, so I reckon Pathfinder being P is a bit of a stretch.\n\nOthers think it could be Wattson, whose surname is Paquette - given that Bangalore refers to herself as Williams, which is her own surname, that's definitely a possibility. Still, it seems more likely that it's a new character for Apex Legends Season 6, if not solely for the fact that a tease like this is bound to be more significant than a reinforcement of lore between existing characters.\n\nIn related news, Respawn opened a studio purely devoted to maintaining Apex Legends live-ops back in May.

The $7.5 million settlement could give past Google Plus members as much as $12, depending on how few folks decide to file a claim.\n\nThose who are part of the lawsuit\u2019s class \u2014 the full definition is down below, but the short version is anyone with a Google+ account between January 1, 2015 and April 2, 2019 \u2014 should be able to go to the listed website and file their claim. If you\u2019re included in that group, you have until October 8 to decide to claim, opt out of the settlement, or file an objection.\n\nThis week, Google finally took the wraps off of the Pixel 4a, over two months after we initially expected it to launch. In their announcement, Google calls the Pixel 4a the \u201chelpful Google phone, at a helpful price,\u201d and it\u2019s hard to debate that claim judging from early reviews.\n\nIt is the second phone after the Pixel 4 to feature the new Google Assistant. On-device speech recognition and language understanding allow for faster commands. This in turn lets you navigate apps and perform certain actions hands-free. For example, you can search Google Photos and after finding the right image send it to a contact via voice. In addition to English, it now works in German, French, Spanish, and Italian.\n\nWhile the formal unveiling of the Pixel 4a after its many delays is plenty exciting, our eyes, as always, are looking ahead to the next release. In the original version of Google France\u2019s announcement of the Pixel 4a, it was spotted that the company included a date for when the Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 should launch \u2014 October 8.\n\nThis October 8 event would most likely be a full-blown Made by Google hardware event, serving as an opportunity for Google to launch their upcoming Android TV dongle as well as the recently teased successor to the Google Home.\n\nOnePlus fans got their first glimpse at Android 11 this week, as the company announced an upcoming update to their China-exclusive HydrogenOS. While full details of the update should be unveiled on August 10, OnePlus spent this week teasing new features in their Android 11 update like an improved dark mode.\n\nOnePlus also shows several designs for its always-on display, another overdue feature that users have been requesting for years. As seen previously, there are some slick and unique designs here, but also some more traditional options that play off of analog and digital clockfaces.\n\nOn the flip side of OnePlus news, it\u2019s now been revealed that the smartphone company has struck a deal with Facebook. Specifically, its phones, starting with the OnePlus 8, come with Facebook App Installer, Facebook Services, and Facebook App Manager pre-installed in such a way that they cannot be uninstalled, only disabled.\n\nWith those apps installed and active, you might notice that updates for Facebook apps may come through that service instead of the Play Store. You may also notice that those services eat up little bits of data even while not in use, which is a tad concerning considering you don\u2019t know what data is being sent back to Facebook.\n\nThe rest of this week\u2019s top stories follow:\n\nAndroid 11 Beta 3 |\n\nAndroid |\n\nApps & Updates |\n\nGoogle Assistant |\n\nGoogle Stadia |\n\nMade by Google |\n\nOnePlus |\n\nSamsung |\n\nVideos |"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/phonemantra.com\/apple-will-make-koss-wish-it-had-a-lawsuit-against-wireless-headphone-makers\/","domain":"phonemantra.com","published_date":"2020-08-11 14:35:00","title":"Apple will make Koss wish it had a lawsuit against wireless headphone makers","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/phonemantra.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Phonemantra-Logo-1024x339-1.png","content":"The Apple company, she said, had not infringed any of the five patents listed in Koss\u2019s suit.

Apple's latest generation of its Apple Watch operating system is packed with new features and updates, from a new way of handling complications to sleep tracking.\n\nwatchOS 7: Compatibility\n\nBefore you download watchOS 7, there are some things of which you should be aware.\n\nFor the first time in two years, a watchOS update is dropping compatibility with older Apple Watches. watchOS 7 is available for Apple Watch Series 3, Series 4, and Series 5 (and comes pre-instaled on Apple's latest watches, the Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Series 6). Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2 owners are not able to update to watchOS 7.\n\nThere's an additional compatibility wrinkle with watchOS, as always. You'll need to have an iPhone running iOS 14 or later to install watchOS 7, so you'll need your iPhone running the latest version of Apple's software before your watch can make the upgrade.\n\nwatchOS 7: Watch faces & Complications\n\nwatchOS 7 X-Large with complication (Image credit: Joseph Keller \/ iMore)\n\nThis year of, watchOS 7 is all about enabling the Apple Watch to do more, and that quality is exemplified in the updates to watch complications and faces. There are several new faces, and others have received some nice updates. Complications, meanwhile, just became a lot more useful.\n\nChronograph Pro was the new watch face in watchOS 7 during the betas, but Apple has added several new faces as part of the final release of watchOS 7: Typograph, a minimalist face that has bold numbers at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 positions; Memoji, which has, that's right, an Animoji or Memoji of your choice just below the time; GMT, an analog face that lets you track both your time and that of another location at once; Count Up, which can help you track elapsed time; Stripes, a highly-customizable face that lets you arrange colorful stripes in various configurations; and Artist, a face designed in collaboration with artist Geoff McFetridge, which shows a portrait of a face that algorithmically changes whenever you raise your wrist.\n\nThere are also updates to the X-Large and Photo faces. X-Large can now hold a single, extra large complication. The Photo face now offers color filters for any photo that you might use on the face to put an even more personal touch on it.\n\nBut complications are the real meat of the watch face updates in watchOS 7, and ties into the other watch face features in the update. Most importantly for complications, apps can now offer multiple complications on a single watch face, and developers can create different versions of the same type of complication (for instance, multiple circular or corner complications).\n\nThis is really cool, and it gives you greater customizability over your watch. You can build a watch face around a particular app. For instance, if Nike updates its Run Club watch app to take advantage of these new capabilities, you could create a watch face devoted to Nike Run Club, just full of complications from that one app. It might, in fact, be my second-favorite feature of this update.\n\nThe complication updates also extend beyond your Apple Watch with watchOS 7. You can now share your particular watch face with other Apple Watch owners. So if you made the perfect surfing watch with Dawn Patrol and the Infograph Modular face or a running watch with Nike Run Club, you can share it with anyone else who might be interested over iMessage.\n\nThis can be done from the Apple Watch by tapping and holding your watch face as if you're going to customize it, then tapping the Share button, then picking a contact to send it to over iMessage. The face style and all the complications you've chosen for it will be sent (sans your data, of course) to your contact. If the recipient doesn't have one or more of the apps behind the complications, they can be directed to download them from the App Store.\n\nBut if you're looking to add new faces to your Apple Watch, iMessage isn't the only way to get them. watchOS 7 is also adding the ability to add a customized face from App Store stories, as well as web pages. If Glow Baby, for instance, is the subject of an App Store story, the App Store editorial team might put a watch face full of child care-focused complications from Glow Baby in the story. You can tap the Add Watch Face button. You'll see the same button on websites that offer watch faces.\n\nAlso, Apple, now that we can share and maybe create many versions of the same face with different complications for distinct purposes, it might be a great time to let us name our watch faces. Especially since we have a shortcut action that lets you change your watch face, picking one would be a lot easier if I didn't have three different versions of the Infograph Modular face.\n\nThere are also a handful of new complications for Apple's built-in apps, like Shortcuts and Sleep (more on those in a bit), world clock, and the camera remote.\n\nThe updates to the watch face and complication experiences in watchOS 7 are certainly welcome, and do more than any previous update to help make the Apple Watch truly your own. None of this is quite on the level of custom or third-party watch faces, but it's great to see Apple enabling this level of customization.\n\nwatchOS 7: Sleep\n\nApple Watch using Sleep app (Image credit: Luke Filipowicz \/ iMore)\n\nSleep tracking has been one of those features that people have been clamoring for on the Apple Watch since it launched. A number of third-party apps have offered this kind of functionality for years, but this is the first time support for sleep tracking has been built into the system.\n\nThe Sleep app in watchOS 7 will track your sleep, but it takes a different approach than many third-party apps in that it's also very focused on getting you to sleep in the first place. It works in tandem with your iPhone, and all the data collected by the Sleep app feeds back into the Health app on the phone.\n\nOne of the central features of the combined iPhone\/Apple Watch sleep experience is the Wind Down. Wind Down helps you create a bedtime routine, and works with the Shortcuts app to help you relax, maybe put on some music or a podcast, open a meditation app, or dim your lights.\n\nThis experience is completely customizable and is all based on the Bedtime and wake-up time that you have set. When you set your wake-up time, you can select one of Apple's alarm sounds, and, optionally, a vibration to go along with it. You can also create a custom vibration. You can set the volume of the alarm, and toggle the ability to snooze the alarm on and off.\n\nYour Apple Watch can alert you when your bedtime is approaching, and you'll also get an alert if your watch's battery level is near or below 30% before your bedtime so you can charge it before you go to sleep. The sleep tracking features need the battery at a level of at least 30%.\n\nOnce your chosen bedtime arrives, your Apple Watch transitions to a simple, grayed-out watch face with large numbers. The watch will also turn on raise-to-wake so as not to disturb you or your partner by turning on accidentally in the night. If, for whatever reason, you do need to view your watch face, just tap the screen.\n\nAs you sleep, your watch will still do things like track calories burned and your heart rate, charting its range in the Sleep section of the Health app. It'll also take not of the time within your set sleeping period that you were actually asleep, and chart that, too.\n\nOnce your alarm goes off, you'll be greeted by the Wake Up screen on your Apple Watch. This display shows you a small weather report for the day ahead and the current battery level of your Apple Watch so you can be reminded to charge the watch before you go about your day.\n\nThe Sleep app on the Apple Watch lets you view and manage your sleep schedule as well as see your data for the previous night and the past 13 nights before that. The Health app on the iPhone provides a more detailed breakdown of your data, and shows your complete sleep history instead of the past two weeks.\n\nOne of the problems that people might have with the current implementation of Sleep tracking on the Apple Watch is level of detail. While it's great to have a chart to track how much I've slept, people who have been tracking this data for years may be disappointed with the lack of specificity in the data. Third-party sleep tracking apps have offered breakdowns analyzing the quality of your sleep, how much time you spend in deep sleep, and more for years, and Apple simply does not break this down.\n\nStill, for anyone interested in keeping track of their sleeping patterns, or looking for a technology-assisted way to establish some sleeping regularity, the Sleep app and sleep tracking in watchOS 7 is a great first step.\n\nIf you're interested in hearing more about the new sleep tracking capabilities on the Apple Watch, Luke Filipowicz has an excellent overview of the features for you to check out.\n\nwatchOS 7: Fitness\n\nwatchOS 7 Fitness app (Image credit: Joseph Keller \/ iMore)\n\nExercise is one of the core activities that the Apple Watch is centered around. This year, there are a number of updates to be aware of in watchOS 7. First, the Activity app has a new name on the iPhone: Fitness. So when you're looking for the app that has your workout and other activity stats on your iPhone, that's the app to look for. The app is still Activity on Apple Watch.\n\nSecond, there are four new exercise types in the Activity app. You've got Dance, Functional Strength Training, Core Training, and a post-workout Cooldown, which is meant to add on to your existing workout as your heart rate and breathing normalize.\n\nApple seems to be particularly proud of the Dance workout type, which uses the sensors in the Apple Watch and machine learning to analyze your dancing in a variety of styles. It can measure when only arm movements are being used, when only your legs are engaged, and when you're using your whole body to dance.\n\nA smaller update that wasn't present in the beta releases, but that can be found in the public release, is the ability to change all of your fitness ring metrics. You've always been able to change your active calorie goal for the out activity ring, but now you can do the same for the middle exercise ring and the inner stand ring. Move the goals up or down, depending on your ability to meet them.\n\nOf course, with changes to fitness on the Apple Watch come changes to the Fitness app on the iPhone. This is probably the most significant change to the app since it launched, event though much of the app is largely unchanged.\n\nThe most important addition is the new Summary page, which offers a breakdown of your recent activity, including a panel for the day's activity, exercise, and stand rings from the Apple Watch, your three most recent workouts, and your trends, which show if your various fitness trends, like daily calorie burn, exercise minutes, and running pace, are moving up or down.\n\nThe Sharing tab has also been updated in Fitness for iPhone. You'll now see your competitions and activity sharing info all in a single spot.\n\nWhile it's not the most substantial update in watchOS 7 and iOS 14, it's always good to see how Apple is working to progress how it tracks our fitness.\n\nwatchOS 7: Siri\n\nwatchOS 7 Shortcuts Complications (Image credit: Joseph Keller \/ iMore)\n\nSiri is one of those features for which I'm always anxious to see improvements. The idea of being able to use my voice for getting anything done on my device has always been attractive to me. Even more so on the Apple Watch, whose small screen makes voice a more practical option.\n\nThe Siri updates in watchOS 7 are important and multi-faceted. They cover everything, from Siri's new translation features to on-device dictation, and the addition of the Shortcuts app to the Apple Watch.\n\nTranslation a new feature for the Apple Watch in watchOS 7. It allows you to translate spoken words in several languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. All you have to do ask Siri how to say a particular word in one of those languages, and you're good to go.\n\nOf course, it's not a full-fledged a translator as the new Translate app in iOS 14, but it's certainly nice to have.\n\nWith watchOS 7, Apple is improving how Siri works on the Apple Watch with on-device dictation. This means that dictation is now processed directly on your Apple Watch, rather than being sent to Apple servers for processing.\n\nWhat's important to realize about this is that, despite the \"on-device dictation\" moniker, this update improves more than just speech-to-text in apps like Messages. In this case, \"dictation\" means any voice request that you make to Siri. So, it's not just messages, but asking for the weather, executing a shortcut, or requests for directions \u2014 all of these will be processed on your Watch.\n\nThis has the effect of speeding everything up, and, in my experience testing this feature extensively, it makes Siri seem a lot smarter. Text-to-speech dictation is also much quicker, making it a better method of text input.\n\nFor me, the biggest update for Siri is the addition of the Shortcuts app to the Apple Watch. It does exactly what you might expect: runs Siri Shortcuts from your Apple Watch. You can add shortcuts to your watch through the Shortcuts app on your iPhone or iPad, and they'll sync to your watch over iCloud. Developers can also choose whether they want their app's shortcut actions to run directly on the Apple Watch, or execute remotely on the paired iPhone.\n\nShortcuts can be as fully-featured on Apple Watch as they are on your iPhone or iPad. For instance, if a shortcut asks a question, you can answer that question in-line on your Apple Watch. This is great for getting directions to your next event, for instance. If you activate a shortcut with Siri, the digital assistant will also ask follow-up questions if your shortcut allows for it.\n\nShortcuts has full support for complications on watchOS 7, which means that you can add multiple individual shortcuts to your watch face. Tap one, and you'll be taken to the Shortcuts app and asked if you want to run the action you selected. You can also have a complication that takes you to the Shortcuts app itself.\n\nAlso, importantly, there are a number of new actions in Shortcuts for iPhone and iPad that directly relate to the Apple Watch. There are actions for pinging your iPhone if it's lost, and turning the always-on display mode for Apple Watch Series 5 either on or off, and setting Theater Mode. But my personal favorite action is Set Watch Face. As you might guess, it lets you set the face on your Apple Watch to any of your available faces, which is great on its own. But I've already combined it with the newly automatic time-based automation trigger to automatically set different watch faces for different times of the day.\n\nFor example, since I go for a run most mornings, I want a watch face that it geared more for activity. So, when 7:15 a.m. rolls around, that face takes over my Apple Watch. About 90 minutes later, well after I'm done with my run and cool down, and I'm getting ready to start my day, it switches to my preferred everyday watch face, Infograph Modular.\n\nThe Siri experience on Apple Watch is much improved in watchOS 7, and is fairly close to the same experience you can get on the iPhone, especially now that shortcuts are supported. I remain hopeful that Siri can be the digital assistant that I've always wanted, and watchOS 7 gives me a reason to be optimistic.\n\nwatchOS 7: Rounding it out\n\nwatchOS 7 Hand Washing (Image credit: Joseph Keller \/ iMore)\n\nThere are other updates in watchOS 7 that are worth talking about, though each is a relatively minor addition compared to features like the Sleep app or the watch face and complication updates.\n\nFirst, there are the new hearing features. The Noise app was added to the Apple Watch in watchOS 6 to measure your hearing health, but watchOS 7 is going further by giving you more control over your keeping your hearing safe.\n\nIt starts with listening notifications. When you reach the World Health Organization's recommended safe weekly listening limit, then your Apple Watch can automatically turn down the volume of your headphones to a safer level. You'll also get a weekly summary of your listening habits and how loudly you've been listening to audio through your headphones so you'll know when to turn it down. If you need to, you can now set limits on how loud your headphones can go directly on your watch.\n\nThe other big change to talk about is cycling in Maps. Cycling directions have come to the Maps app on watchOS 7, and the app does more than give you directions. Maps on watchOS will do things like give you different types of route options (fastest, shortest, or the suggested route).\n\nYou'll get elevation estimates for each route, and as you travel, watchOS makes it easy to search nearby locations for pick-me-ups like food and coffee. You'll also be notified when your route has instructions like \"dismount and walk,\" such as when you come up against stairs.\n\nFinally, there's hand washing. These days, we're all more aware of how important it is to wash our hands, and how important it is to wash our hands for 20 seconds. The Apple Watch can, if you turn it on, now automatically detect when you start washing your hands and give you a 20-second countdown timer.\n\nThis detection is possible because your Apple Watch listens for the sounds of running water and soap squishing (yes, really), and for the motion of your hands that it thinks might be hand washing. Apple uses, you guessed it, machine learning to analyze this input, and starts the timer retroactively to when it began picking up the data. That means that you might not see the timer until you're a few seconds into your wash, but you'll still get the credit for those seconds.\n\nWhile these features might seem small on their own, they're part of the larger theme of watchOS 7: doing more.\n\nwatchOS 7: Time marches on\n\nThe theme with watchOS 7 seems to be \"doing more.\" There are many additions to the Apple Watch experience, rather than the refinements that other platforms seem to be getting. The Sleep app and Shortcuts, for instance, are important newcomers to the watch experience. Even the complication changes, though an update to an existing feature, can radically alter how we customize watch faces going forward. Face sharing makes it easier than ever to personalize your watch.\n\nWhile iOS and macOS (and to a certain extent, iPadOS) still get exciting new features year after year, those platforms seem like they have long since matured. But with watchOS, it feels like, five years on, we're still watching it come together. watchOS 7 seems to be an excellent next step along that journey, full of exciting new updates that make the Apple Watch even more compelling.\n\nwatchOS 7 is an excellent update for your Apple Watch, and you can get it alongside iOS 14."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.ausgamers.com\/news\/read\/3629153\/looks-like-wb-games-isnt-up-for-sale","domain":"ausgamers.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 02:39:00","title":"Looks Like WB Games Isn't Up For Sale","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.ausgamers.com\/gameres\/7837\/images\/695\/starefieldbanner.jpg","content":"\"The Warner Bros.

A class action lawsuit filed in San Mateo Superior Court by Illinois resident Kelly Whalen on Aug. 10 alleges that Facebook and Instagram are routinely harvesting and sharing its users\u2019 biometric data without informing them or asking for consent to collect it. The lawsuit requests Facebook pay every member of the class $5,000 for each intentional violation of the Illinois BIPA act, which prohibits misuse of biometric data, or statutory damages of $1,000 for every negligent violation of the law \u2014 Business Insider estimated that could total up to $500 billion in fines given that at least 100 million Instagram users could be included in the class. Facebook recently paid $650 million in July to settle a similar case about its misuse of facial recognition data. \u201cThis suit is baseless. Instagram doesn\u2019t use Face Recognition technology,\u201d Facebook spokesperson Stephanie Otway told TheWrap in an email. Whalen\u2019s class includes any Illinois resident who has had their biometric identifiers or facial geometry scans at all obtained by Facebook through photos uploaded to its Instagram app. The plaintiff is represented by Chicago-based law firm Carlson Lynch, which did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s requests for comment. The lawsuit reports Facebook began using facial recognition technology in 2010 and started using it on Instagram after it bought the San Francisco-based photo sharing network in 2012. It essentially uses the tech to scan photos of faces uploaded to the Instagram app to collect a profile of unique facial recognition and other biological data for specific users. \u201cFacebook is actively collecting, storing, disclosing, profiting from, and otherwise using the biometric information of its reportedly more than 100 million Instagram users without any written notice or informed written consent, including millions of Illinois residents,\u201d the lawsuit reads. The practice is problematic in part because it doesn\u2019t allow users to opt-out of data collection \u2014 \u201cIndeed, Instagram users are not even given an opportunity to provide a written release because Facebook automatically processes content and shares it across its platforms,\u201d the filing said. \u201cEven if a user does not have facial recognition activated on their personal account, their photo may still be scanned, collected, and entered into Facebook\u2019s database if it matches with a user\u2019s data who does have the facial recognition setting activated,\u201d the lawsuit notes. \u201cThis further means that one can never truly \u201copt out\u201d because Facebook must capture and compare the biometrics of a face before learning if that face in fact matches with faces of users who have their facial recognition setting turned on or off.\u201d The filing said that Instagram reported 118 million users in the United States last year \u2014 and points out that Whalen and other defendants (and most Instagram users) are unable to know which third parties Instagram allowed to view their facial recognition data or for what purpose. Instagram users whose data has been collected by Facebook \u201chave no recourse for the fact that their biologically unique information has been compromised,\u201d the lawsuit states.

And, like many things that feel great, it turns out there are some adverse health effects to it as well.\n\nAt Jalopnik, Erin Marquis has the details \u2014 which come from a recent study by researchers at the University of Surrey. The gist of the study, which was conducted in 10 cities across the world?\n\nIrrespective of the city and car model used, a windows-open setting showed the highest exposure, followed by fan-on and recirculation. Pollution exposure for windows-open during off-peak hours was 91 percent and 40 percent less than morning and evening peak hours, respectively. The study also found that the windows-open setting exposed car passengers to hotspots of air pollution for up to a third of the total travel length.\n\nTurning on a car\u2019s recirculation option, the study found, cut down on the amount of pollution by 80%.\n\nAs Marquis writes, the choice of cities may feature a few known for their pollution, but the range of the study\u2019s findings should alarm drivers all over the world.

Noted analysts have laid out the new additions expected in this year's iPhone 12, which is also expected to be the first 5G iPhone. Along with this, the new batch of iPhones are also expected to feature an updated design language, while strategic additions in terms of features and scope of usage may be made to the camera department as well. With a rather exhaustive set of leaks and rumours at hand, here's looking at everything that we know so far about the new generation iPhone 12.\n\nDesign and display\n\nReports indicate Apple may launch four variants of the iPhone 12 for the first time. As a result, the iPhone 12 lineup may include the standard, entry level iPhone 12 with a 5.4-inch display, an iPhone 12 Max\/Plus with a 6.1-inch display, an iPhone 12 Pro (also with a 6.1-inch display), and an iPhone 12 Pro Max with a 6.7-inch display. Apple is finally said to be moving to an all-OLED display lineup for iPhones, and offer a wider range of form factors with its devices. The 5.4-inch iPhone 12, for instance, is expected to be one of the most compact smartphones in the market, should the rumour turn out to be true. Without the thick bezels of the new iPhone SE, the iPhone 12 can potentially be as compact as the former, and this can bode well for compact smartphone aficionados. On the other end of the spectrum, the 6.7-inch display size of the rumoured iPhone 12 Pro Max is set to be the largest iPhone display to date.\n\nOther features of the new Retina display on the upcoming iPhones may be 120Hz fast refresh rates, and proportionately higher touch response rates, with what rumours have suggested may be called 'ProMotion' display panels. Reports have stated that the iPhone 12 range may be thinner than the iPhone 11, with the former expected to sport metal bodies with flat edges, instead of the glass body and rounded edge design that Apple has been following since the 2017 iPhone X. The design language of the new generation iPhones may be a cross between the flat edged build of the iPhone 4, fused with Apple's new generation narrow-bezel displays and the larger sizes. Even the notch on the display, which became ubiquitous in the smartphone industry thanks to the iPhone X, is expected to get smaller this time.\n\nPerformance and cameras\n\nApple's new, A14 Bionic processor, along with iOS 14, are the two confirmed new features of the upcoming iPhones. While iPhones have never been specifically rated for RAM amounts, the iPhone 12 Pro Max may come with up to 6GB of memory, as per rumours. Storage options are slated to range between 128GB and 512GB. In terms of cameras, the overall configuration is expected to remain similar to what the iPhone 11 range brought to the table.\n\nAs a result, the iPhone 12 and 12 Plus\/Max variants are said to get dual-camera units, while the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max are expected to get triple camera units. Alongside these units, all variants of the iPhone 12 lineup are expected to get depth-sensing Lidar sensors to add new augmented reality features to the new iPhones. Apple, much like Google, is also expected to upgrade its computational photography performance, wit reports suggesting up to 4K video recording at 120\/240fps for smooth, high resolution slow mo videos.\n\nCharging, connectivity and prices\n\nMany reports have suggested that the iPhone 12 units will not come with a charging adapter in the box, but Apple is expected to launch a new fast charging adapter that users may buy separately. The iPhone 12 will apparently no longer get the wired EarPods in the box either, and in terms of charging interface, the iPhone 12 range is said to finally move on to USB-C, from Lightning. Wireless charging is also expected to be present.\n\n5G is the big news in connectivity, of course, but that may not have a big repercussion in India immediately. All things taken together, reports have suggested a $649 starting price tag for the iPhone 12, which would be highly competitive since Apple is said to be upgrading its displays to OLED panels and also offer 5G connectivity. In terms of India pricing, this might mean that the iPhone 12 may cost about the same as the iPhone 11 when it launches here. The iPhone 12 Pro Max, meanwhile, is said to cost $1,099 onward, which in India will almost certainly be priced at above Rs 1,00,000."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/smart-tv-vs-streaming-device\/","domain":"mashable.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 18:53:00","title":"Smart TVs are coming for Roku. Here's why that's a bad thing.","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/helios-i.mashable.com\/imagery\/articles\/01KUEXOLDq9MCGgC0DmtrIU\/hero-image.fill.size_1248x702.v1614275275.png","content":"Last week, Roku announced more than $356 million in revenue, a 42 percent increase from the same quarter last year.\n\nWhile the coronavirus pandemic has created a boom in the streaming industry, Roku\u2019s good fortunes may be short-lived, according to a new report from The Information .\n\nWhy is that? The rise of the smart TVs.\n\nSmart TV takeover\n\nSmart TVs, internet-connected television sets with popular streaming service apps built-in, are getting cheaper, which in turn make them more attractive to consumers. For example, the best-selling smart TV on Amazon right now is a 32-inch 720p LED TV by TCL. It has nearly 18,000 reviews. The TV sells for $130. That's cheap.\n\nAccording to data from market research firm Parks Associates , 54 percent of U.S. households now own a smart TV. That number eclipses the market share of standalone streaming devices, which stands at 42 percent. The report from The Information highlights a projection from the Consumer Technology Association that estimates that 35 million smart TVs will be purchased this year, compared to only 22 million streaming devices such as the Apple TV and the Amazon Fire TV stick.\n\nThat might be a good thing for streaming services like HBOMax and NBC\u2019s Peacock. Both companies have struggled to get their apps on Roku and Amazon devices due to disagreements over revenue share and customer data. For now, Roku and Amazon Fire stick users are stuck with the out-of-date HBO Now app, which doesn't have all the titles HBO Max does. They also still don't have access to Peacock.\n\nMashable Light Speed Want more out-of-this world tech, space and science stories? Sign up for Mashable's weekly Light Speed newsletter. Loading... Sign Me Up By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Thanks for signing up!\n\nRoku and Amazon, which also makes the Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Cube, have a stranglehold over the market. The two companies make up about 70 percent of streaming devices sold.\n\nWhy streaming devices are better\n\nThe increasing dominance of smart TVs is a bad thing for consumers. For some casual streamers, perhaps the ease of having everything in one device is worth any trade-offs. But, standalone devices provide a superior experience, at least when compared to current smart TV offerings.\n\nAs my colleague, Alex Perry, previously mentioned , many of the smart TVs just don\u2019t prioritize the user experience when it comes to built-in apps. These TVs are bogged down by cheap hardware in order to keep prices low, which in turn churns out laggy menus and slow loading times for their streaming service apps.\n\nIn addition, there are a slew of smart TV models from a multitude of companies: Samsung, Vizio, Toshiba, LG, just to name a few. Certain features, like HDR support for Netflix, are not available for all of them. It can be daunting to check which model of TV is compatible with new versions of streaming apps.\n\nRemember that dirt cheap $130 TCL smart TV I mentioned earlier? If you look through those thousands of reviews on Amazon for the TV, you'll find quite a few people complaining about how slow the TV streaming interface is.\n\nMost of these TV manufacturers are primarily hardware companies focused on, well, making TV sets. Software, CPU processors, and operating systems are not what they focus on, unlike Roku, Amazon, and Apple. If you've ever tried to use even a basic TV menu interface, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Standalone devices will work better and be more up-to-date than smart TVs when it comes to streaming apps.\n\nAnother plus of streaming devices: they're more affordable, too. Roku's least expensive streaming stick sells for $29. The Amazon Fire TV Stick is $40. If you need to replace one, or a new model comes out, it's cheaper to buy a new one than to splurge on an entirely new TV set.\n\nRoku isn\u2019t going anywhere for now. But if smart TVs totally take over, it's consumers who could be hurt most."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/spacenews.com\/northrop-grumman-completes-ground-test-of-solid-booster-for-ulas-vulcan-centaur\/","domain":"spacenews.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 23:57:21","title":"Northrop Grumman completes ground test of solid booster for ULA's Vulcan Centaur","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/spacenews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/NorthropGrummanSuccessfullyCompletesFirstQualificationTestofNewRocketMotorforUnitedLaunchAlliance_1_2691a694-fe14-4e7e-8d7e-9c4ab7977f65-prv.jpg?fit=900%2C596&ssl=1","content":"WASHINGTON \u2014 Northrop Grumman on Aug. 13 completed the first qualification test of a new strap-on rocket motor developed for United Launch Alliance\u2019s future vehicle Vulcan Centaur, the company said.\n\nThe static firing of the 63-inch-diameter graphite epoxy motor known as GEM 63XL took place at Northrop Grumman\u2019s facility in Promontory, Utah.\n\nDuring the test the motor fired for approximately 90 seconds, producing nearly 449,000 pounds of thrust to qualify the motor\u2019s internal insulation, propellant grain, ballistics and nozzle, Charlie Precourt, Northrop Grumman vice president of propulsion systems, said in a news release.\n\nNorthrop Grumman last month delivered to ULA three GEM 63 solid rocket motors that will fly later this year on an Atlas 5 vehicle.\n\nThe GEM 63 is 66-feet long and the GEM 63XL version is 72-feet long.

Your iPhone or Android smartphone will still ring when you receive a VOIP call from that contact, but your phone won't vibrate or make noise when a new message arrives.\n\nAccording to @WABetaInfo \u2013 an account that trawls through the latest beta versions of WhatsApp to unearth clues about upcoming features \u2013 WhatsApp is looking to switch the one-year mute option for an ever-lasting \"mute always\" setting.\n\nThat makes a certain amount of sense.

This is due to supply not yet outstripping demand. However, it's still difficult to find the GeForce RTX 3080, the GeForce RTX 3090 and practically every other RTX 30-series GPUs at fair prices.\n\nAs an aside, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs has been tipped for Q3 launch, so it might be worth waiting for that if you can't find a GeForce RTX 3080. Though there's no guarantee you'll be able to find those GPUs either. And if rumors are correct, the RTX 4090 may be the only RTX 4000 series card released in 2022.\n\nSo unless you're considering getting a pre-built PC to secure a GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, like our computing writer Tony Polanco did, then your best hope in securing a graphics card is to check out the list of retailers that we've rounded up below and sign up to any stock updates, then apply a degree of patience.\n\nOur list contains U.S. and U.K. retailers that have the GeForce RTX 3080 on their books, as well as the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.\n\nOverall, there's a wind of change when it comes to finding Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 restocks, as well as fresh stock of other GeForce RTX 30-series cards.\n\nWe are now seeing a downward trend in prices sparking a sign that supply is catching up with demand, as well as card makers aiming to reduce prices so GPUs are more in line with MSRP. And graphics card stock appears to hang around on virtual shelves a little longer than last year. As such, it may now be the best time to start looking at buying a new Nvidia or AMD graphics card.\n\nBut equally, you still might want to wait before upgrading your graphics card \u2014 here\u2019s why.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.

This includes: Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, B&H Photo, Office Max, Overclockers and eBuyer.\n\nLatest Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 deals\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080: Where to buy\n\nAt the moment the GeForce RTX 3080 is sold out at pretty much every major retailer. As such, you're best bet is to grab an RTX 3080 when you spot one. But also have a bit of patience and it should be back in stock shortly. Make sure to check the retailers using the links below to see if they have the RTX 3080 back in stock.\n\nOne trick: Be sure to have all your payment and shipping information saved on the retailer's site, so you don't have to spend precious minutes filling it out \u2014 which could mean the difference between picking up Nvidia's newest GPU and walking away empty-handed.\n\nWhere to buy Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 in the U.S.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080: from $699 at Nvidia\n\nNvidia offers a range of RTX 3080 models, including its own base model as well as third-party options from the likes of EVGA and MSI. But they all go fast.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080: from $999 at Best Buy\n\nBest Buy has a selection of GeForce RTX 3080 cards from Nvidia itself to versions from EVGA , MSI and EVGA. But they're all sold out. You can sign up to be notified of when stocks are back.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080: from $1,999 at Amazon\n\nWhen Amazon has replenished its stock of the GeForce RTX 3080, you'll have a bountiful selection of card to choose from. However, none are available at the moment.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080: from $1,099 at B&H\n\nB&H has a good selection of GeForce RTX 3080 cards. Or at least it will when they are back in stock. Expect standard versions of the RTX 3080 as well as overclocked models.\n\nWhere to buy Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti in the U.S.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: from $1,199 @ Nvidia\n\nNvidia itself is offering the new Founders Edition graphics card, as well as links to other retailers that are selling third-party versions of the GPU. It is currently sold out.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: from $1,299 @ Newegg\n\nNewegg is offering a rather comprehensive selection of GeForce RTX 3080 Ti cards, including models from MSI, PNY, Gigabyte. There's a lot of choice on here, but every single listing is currently sold out.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: from $1,299 @ Amazon\n\nAmazon doesn't currently have any stock of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti graphics card. Though it does have a few listings for pre-built PCs that include the GPU. Which is one way to get hold one.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: from $1,949 @ B&H\n\nB&H will undoubtedly offer a good selection of GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPUs when the stock drops. You can expect both the standard versions of the RTX 3080 Ti as well as overclocked models. Currently listed as \"coming soon\".\n\nWhere to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 in the U.K\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 has also sold out at a lot of U.K. hardware retailers. And it looks like the websites for Overclockers and Scan, two major PC component retailers in Britain, are down. We'd hazard a bet that's due to fevered interest in the RTX 3080.\n\nAs such, your options are limited to Nvidia and eBuyer at the moment. But we'll keep an eye out to see if the RTX 3080 pops up on other sites.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080: from \u00a3649 at Nvidia\n\nThe RTX 3080 is available at Nvidia UK starting at \u00a3649, but stock is all but gone as of this writing.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080: from \u00a31,179 at eBuyer\n\nThere are no GeForce RTX 3080 cards in stock at eBuyer. But it will allow you to pre-order the card from the likes of Asus and Gigabyte.\n\nGeForce RTX 3080: from \u00a3699 at Scan\n\nScan now has a page that will show when the RTX 3080 is expected to be back in stock.\n\nWhere to buy the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti in the U.K.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: from \u00a31,049 @ Nvidia\n\nThe RTX 3080 Ti is being sold by Nvidia UK for \u00a31,049. You should soon see listings of both the Founders Edition as well as third-party models, though none are in stock.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: from \u00a31,179 @ eBuyer\n\nWe've already seen quite a handful of \"coming soon\" listings on eBuyer showcasing the new RTX 3080 Ti from various manufacturers, including MSI, Gigabyte, ZOTAC and more. Make sure to visit the page again frequently for when these drop.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti: from \u00a31,299 @ Overclockers\n\nOverclockers is expected to offer a range of the newly announced RTX 3080 Ti cards, though for the time being all listings are labeled \"this product available soon\". Definitely, one to keep a close eye on.\n\nWhere to buy Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 desktops\n\nIf you're desperate to get GeForce GTX 3080 power, then you might want to consider getting a pre-built PC with the graphics card in it.\n\nOrigin PC will let you configure a desktop with an RTX 3080 in it. The same is true of iBuyPower, with a quartet of PC's with the RTX 3080 sitting alongside powerful AMD and Intel processors.\n\nYou can also configure an Alienware Aurora, our pick for the best gaming PC, with an RTX 3080 GPU.\n\nIn the U.K. Cyberpower has the Infinity X10 gaming PC with the GeForce RTX 3080. The graphics card comes with a healthy specification but expect to pay over \u00a32,000 for the privilege.\n\nAnd bear in mind that all the above PCs are pretty expensive with prices around the $2,000 mark. And a lot have already sold out or selling quickly.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 is one of the most interesting graphics cards Nvidia has made of late, especially in terms of power and price. So don't be surprised if it's tricky to find for another few weeks yet.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 with 12GB of memory\n\nNvidia is now selling a new RTX 3080 with 12GB of memory through select partners. The new RTX 3080 has 8,960 CUDA cores compared to the 8,704 found in the 10GB RTX 3080. The GPU also has 20% more cumulative bandwidth than the current RTX 3080, due to a 384-bit memory bus. Nvidia recommends a 750W power supply, which is 350W in total compared to the 320W on the regular RTX 3080.\n\nSister-site PC Gamer listed the prices for the new RTX 3080. There will not be a Founder's Edition of the new card. As such, you can only get the RTX 3080 with 12GB from Nvidia's partners. Note that we do not have an official MSRP for the card. The prices below are what each of the respective partners is selling it for.\n\nEVGA has the EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 12GB XC3 Ultra Gaming for $1,250. This is listed on the company's website for $1,250. The EVGA GeForce RTX 3080 12GB FTW3 Ultra Gaming costs $1,300. This card is only available to EVGA Elite Members.\n\nAsus is selling two versions of its RTX 3080 12GB graphics cards. The ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3080 12GB OC is listed for \u20ac1,639 ($1,858) while the TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 3080 12GB OC is listed for \u20ac1,519 ($1,722). As PC Gamer points out, these prices are well above the RTX 3090's launch price of $1,499.\n\nSwipe to scroll horizontally Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 specs Header Cell - Column 0 RTX 3080 12GB RTX 3080 10GB GPU GA102 GA102 Lithography Samsung 8nm Samsung 8nm CUDA Cores 8,960 8,704 SMs 70 68 Tensor Cores 272 272 RT Cores 70 68 Memory bus 384-bit 320-bit Memory capacity 12GB GDDR6X 10GB GDDR6X Memory speed 19Gbps 19Gbps Memory bandwidth 912GB\/s 760GB\/s TGP 350W 320W\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3080 performance\n\nNvidia has claimed the GeForce RTX 3080 is up to twice as fast as the GeForce RTX 2080 it replaces and how it will stomp the RTX 2080 Ti. It's a bold claim indeed.\n\nNvidia pitted the RTX 3080 against the RTX 2080 Ti when running Doom Eternal at 4K on Ultra settings. The RTX 3080 is some 50 percent faster than the last top-end Nvidia graphics card, delivering frame rates well above 100fps. And that's likely before a lot of optimization has been done.\n\nOur sibling publication Tom's Hardware put the GeForce RTX 3080 to the test and declared that it delivered a \"generational leap in performance.\" And true to its claims, the RTX 3080 offers significant gains in performance over the RTX 2080 Ti.\n\n\"The bottom line, if you don't mind spoilers, is that the RTX 3080 FE is 33% faster than the RTX 2080 Ti, on average. Or, if you prefer other points of comparison, it's 57% faster than the RTX 2080 Super, 69% faster than the RTX 2080 FE \u2014 heck, it's even 26% faster than the Titan RTX!\" Jarred Walton said in his review.\n\n\"But there's a catch: We measured all of those 'percent faster' results across our test suite running at 4K ultra settings. The lead narrows if you drop down to 1440p, and it decreases even more at 1080p. It's still 42% faster than a 2080 FE at 1080p ultra, but this is very much a card made for higher resolutions.\"\n\nSuffice to say, the GeForce RT 3080 is one impressive graphics card, though you'll need an equally impressive overall PC to get the most out of it.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090: Where to buy\n\nWhere to buy Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 in the U.S.\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 3090: $1,499 at Nvidia\n\nNvidia offers its own RTX 3090 model, as well as those from a few third-party graphics card makers.\n\nGeForce RTX 3090: from $2,129 at Newegg\n\nNewegg has a comprehensive selection of GeForce RTX 3090 cards.

It isn\u2019t faultless, and its improvements over the original Galaxy Watch are limited, but if the middling battery life or high price don\u2019t put you off this may be perfect for you.\n\nWhy you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\n\nTwo-minute review\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 3 isn't the latest model in the line any longer, but as our Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 review will demonstrate, it's still well worth considering.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the perfect smartwatch, but it has a dazzling design, a vivid display, and a variety of new fitness features to help you track your progress across a wide range of activities, and stay motivated.\n\nSamsung has stuck with a traditional-looking circular display shape, and a rotatable raised bezel that enables you to physically cycle through on-screen menus. It\u2019s tactile, and that click, click, click as you navigate the round interface feels satisfying.\n\nIt looks better than the first-generation device as well - the design is slimmer (and lighter), making for a more svelte-looking device that could compete with the likes of the Apple Watch 7 in a beauty contest.\n\nThe new fitness features improve the activity tracking that you expect to get from any smartwatch now and includes an electrocardiogram - something that wasn't so common back in those days, as well as fall detection too.\n\nThe battery life on the Galaxy Watch 3 could be better, but it\u2019s not disappointing if you\u2019re happy to put your smartwatch on charge for a few hours after a couple of days. If you\u2019re expecting a device that can last weeks, however, you probably won\u2019t want to read on any further.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best smartwatch to pair with an Android phone, you want the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, but this comes close. If you own an iPhone, this may still even beat some older Apple Watches if you\u2019re looking for a circular device rather than Apple\u2019s trademark squared design and you like what you see.\n\nOut now\n\nStarts at $399 \/ \u00a3399 \/ AU$649\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 3 specs Screen sizes: 41\/45mm\n\nWeight: 48.2g\/53.8g\n\nSoftware: Tizen OS 5.5\n\nRAM: 1GB\n\nStorage: 8GB\n\nGPS: Built-in\n\nBattery capacity: 247 \/ 340mAh\n\nWireless charging: Yes, Qi\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 was unveiled alongside the Galaxy Note 20 and Galaxy Note 20 Ultra at the company\u2019s virtual Unpacked launch for 2020. That took place on August 6, so it's getting much trickier to track down the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 now. Not least because the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 range is now available.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 price was originally $399 \/ \u00a3399 \/ AU$649 for the smaller 41mm model, and $429 \/ \u00a3419 \/ AU$699 for the larger 45mm version. LTE connectivity raised the price further, to $449 \/ \u00a3439 \/ AU$799 for the 41mm version, and $479 \/ \u00a3459 \/ AU$849 for the 45mm variant.\n\nExpect to find it much cheaper now, although you may have to stick with a refurbished model if you're desperate to get hold of one.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 3: design and display\n\n1.2-inch or 1.3-inch circular AMOLED screen\n\n360 x 360 resolution\n\nSlim, light and comfortable\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 3\u2019s design is more refined than the original Galaxy Watch, and the design team has engineered another smartwatch masterpiece here. It\u2019s slimmer, lighter, and more comfortable to wear than the original device.\n\nYou have the choice of two sizes, with a 41mm being the smaller option, and a 45mm model for those who prefer a larger watch on their wrist. For the purpose of this review we\u2019ve tested the 45mm variant, so elements of the user experience with the smaller model may differ slightly.\n\nThe core features are the same across both models, with just a couple of small differences in the specs.\n\nYou\u2019re getting a 1.2-inch (41mm) or 1.3-inch (45mm) Circular Super AMOLED panel, with a full-color always-on display. From our time with the larger watch we\u2019ve found this to be the perfect size, as it was on the original 45mm device.\n\nThe display has a resolution of 360 x 360, which at this size is perfect for looking at stats and swiping through the menus. The device is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass DX; for some reason it\u2019s not DX+ as on the original Watch, and we\u2019re not sure why, or what it means - we\u2019ve reached out to Samsung for an explanation.\n\nThe display is bright and easy to read in all types of light, so you shouldn\u2019t struggle to see this screen even when you\u2019re exercising outdoors.\n\nImage 1 of 2 (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 is 14% slimmer than the original Galaxy Watch, yet keeps the same attractive circular screen shape and size. The ornate rotating bezel that doubles as a way to navigate the on-screen menus also remains, albeit in a less chunky state.\n\nBoth variants of the watch come in stainless steel, with the 45mm weighing 53.8g and the 41mm 48.2g. There\u2019s also a new extra-light titanium model, which is only available in the 45mm size and weighs 43g. This isn\u2019t currently on sale yet, but we\u2019re expecting it to cost extra.\n\nWe found the Galaxy Watch 3 to be comfortable to wear casually as well as during workouts - it\u2019s not going to be as trim as a fitness tracker, but if you\u2019re looking for a smartwatch this is going to be a comfortable choice.\n\nSo what colors can you get? You can see the Mystic Black finish pictured throughout this review, and the 45mm Watch 3 also comes in a Mystic Silver version that\u2019s slightly lighter. Both variants come with black leather straps.\n\nIf you opt for the smaller 41mm device you\u2019ll have the choice of Mystic Silver or Mystic Bronze colors. Both of these also come with leather straps, so whichever size and color combo you opt for you\u2019ll have to spend extra on another strap if you want a more fitness-friendly silicone material.\n\nThe 45mm is compatible with all 22mm straps, and the 41mm device is designed for use with 20mm straps.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 3: performance and software\n\nDated chipset yet reasonable performance\n\n1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage\n\nRuns Tizen, not Wear OS\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 3 is running on the same chipset that powered the original Galaxy Watch from Samsung, which may disappoint some, although we didn\u2019t find this to be an issue when using the smartwatch.\n\nApps loaded as quickly as we\u2019d expect them to, and that\u2019s partly due to the 1GB of RAM included here, which seemed to be enough. An odd element is the LTE version of the original Galaxy Watch sported 1.5GB of RAM, but the company has seen fit to drop that here.\n\nProcessing power isn\u2019t often a major thing on a smartwatch though \u2013 there\u2019s less to run here than on a typical phone \u2013 and we found that the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 continued to perform well throughout our entire time testing it.\n\n\n\nAll versions of the device come with 8GB of storage, and we found the OS and pre-loaded apps were already using 3.59GB of this space, so if you want to fill your watch up with apps and music you\u2019ll have around 4GB to use.\n\nImage 1 of 2 The Tizen app store (Image credit: TechRadar) The Tizen app store (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 3 is running Samsung\u2019s Tizen software, which had been used for a few years on Samsung's smartwatches by this point, but notably the newer Galaxy Watch 4 has moved back to Wear OS.\n\nThe latest Tizen OS 5.5 software is on offer here, and if you\u2019ve used a Samsung smartwatch in the few years prior to this model you'll know what to expect \u2013 this is accomplished software, although Samsung\u2019s ecosystem doesn\u2019t have as many third-party apps as watchOS (on the Apple Watch) or Wear OS.\n\nInstead, you\u2019ll be using a lot of the features already included on the smartwatch, or downloading some third-party services from the Tizen store. Some big-name apps such as Google Maps are missing here, but Samsung has included a lot of alternatives that mean the overall experience is still satisfying.\n\nNavigating around the watch is easy, and thanks to the rotating bezel we found scrolling through menus to be a genuine joy. You can tap and swipe on the screen with your finger if you wish, but we think you\u2019ll find yourself using that bezel instead.\n\nIn terms of compatibility, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 works with both Android devices and iPhones. Certain features are optimized for Samsung handsets, and similarly some elements work better on Android devices than on iPhones, but generally, Samsung watches work as well with iPhones.\n\n\n\nThat said, it won\u2019t integrate as well as an Apple Watch. You\u2019ll miss out on being able to reply to iMessages, for example, though message notifications can be seen on the watch face, and features like 'Find My Phone' aren\u2019t possible.\"\n\nYou\u2019ll need an iPhone 5 or above running iOS 9 software for this to be compatible, or if you\u2019re on Android you\u2019ll need a device running Android 5 software with 1.5GB of RAM or more.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a smartwatch that lets you leave your phone at home, there\u2019s also an LTE-ready version of both devices. You\u2019ll be able to slot in your SIM card and have an internet connection away from your phone, so you can take phone calls and use online features while running or otherwise on the move.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 3: fitness\n\nOffers fall detection and on-demand VO2 Max readings\n\nIncludes all the expected health and fitness tracking features\n\nFitness is a key component of the Galaxy Watch 3, and while this isn\u2019t a sequel to the Galaxy Watch Active 2, it does bring a lot of fitness-focused features we saw on that device to the main series.\n\nSeven activities will auto-trigger Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 fitness tracking, whether or not you forget to start the tracking, which is super-handy. These are: running, walking, swimming, cycling, rowing, elliptical workouts, and dynamic workouts (basically aerobics, or anything with big movements).\n\nWe\u2019ve tested these for running, walking, and cycling and found that it worked every single time \u2013 it\u2019s tack-sharp on kicking in 10 minutes after we started working out, so you\u2019ll have peace of mind knowing your watch is tracking even if you forget to set up a workout.\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nThe Galaxy Watch 3 is also there at the end of automatically tracked workouts \u2013 it promptly asks if you\u2019ve finished a workout when it thinks you\u2019re done. It was even smart enough to know that we stopped cycling and transitioned to walking, where the Apple Watch just rolls on, messing up your cycling pace.\n\nIn between workouts, if you\u2019re on a run or walk and stop to snap a scenic photo, it\u2019ll auto-pause tracking. It feels like it keeps you honest. In total, there are 40 workouts that can be tracked \u2013 everything from yoga to crunches, deadlifts to pilates. You\u2019ll want to set up those that we haven\u2019t listed above, as they don\u2019t automatically track, which you can do within the app or via Bixby\u2019s voice assistant.\n\nSamsung\u2019s voice assistant is okay for starting workouts, but it didn\u2019t always work on the first try so you may want to use the apps through the rotating bezel or on the screen instead to ensure you don\u2019t get annoyed.\n\nSamsung has helpfully equipped the Watch 3 with stress tracking, taking into account peak heart rates and suggesting breathing exercises too.\n\nBrand-new here are fall detection, something we\u2019ve seen on the Apple Watch 4 and above, and on-demand VO2 Max readings. The latter calculates the maximum amount of oxygen your body can take in during exercise, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s been trickling down from high-end fitness trackers to mainstream smartwatches recently.\n\nNote, though, that this feature isn\u2019t available everywhere at launch. Both that and the SpO2 monitor \u2013 a tool to help you detect sleep apnea \u2013 are now rolling out in the US now, but it's unclear when they'll be available in other markets.\n\nWe've yet to use these features on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 as they've only just started rolling out, but we\u2019ll be sure to update this review when we\u2019ve had the opportunity to test them.\n\nWe\u2019ve yet to test the Galaxy Watch 3 in a swimming pool owing to coronavirus restrictions, but we have gotten it wet in a sink and it survived. With a design that\u2019s IP68 water-resistant you should be able to swim with the device in your average pool \u2013 but it\u2019s not built for salt water, so keep it out of the ocean.\n\nSamsung only supplies a leather strap with the Galaxy Watch 3, so if you want to work out with the device you\u2019ll likely want to opt for a silicone band from Samsung or a third-party supplier.\n\nThere\u2019s also sleep tracking on the Galaxy Watch 3. Samsung is touting a partnership with the US National Sleep Institute, which is supposed to offer deeper insights into elements like REM cycles where we dream most vividly. The watch automatically tracks your sleep cycles, and greets you every morning with sleep quality reports, and tips on how to get better-quality shut-eye.\n\nWe found this to work well too, and you\u2019ll be given a \u2018Sleep Score\u2019 to show you how well your night\u2019s sleep was. It breaks down data into light, deep and REM sleep, as well as a total of your sleep patterns.\n\nIt has a woman's health section too for monitoring menstrual cycles, and its effects on your fitness.\n\nThere\u2019s also stress tracking, with your stress levels monitored every 10 minutes by default you can switch it off, or set it to work continuously). Your watch will give you a warning when you\u2019re stressed, and suggest breathing exercises you can do to try and lower your stress levels.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 3: battery life\n\n247mAh or 340mAh battery\n\nLarger model has life of 2-3 days\n\nControversially, Samsung opted to decrease the capacity of the battery in the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 compared to the original device. That\u2019s likely a key way the company has managed to slim and lighten this device compared to the Galaxy Watch.\n\nIt\u2019s a 340mAh cell \u2013 the original device was 472mAh \u2013 but despite the reduced capacity we found it to work surprisingly well, although it won\u2019t give you that long lasting four to five days battery life. Instead, you should expect around two to three days of use from the Galaxy Watch 3.\n\nThat\u2019s with general usage, and if you\u2019re exercising a lot \u2013 and so using the GPS and heart rate monitor even more \u2013 you may see battery life closer to a day and a half, but if you\u2019re happy to recharge your smartwatch overnight you shouldn\u2019t have any issues.\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nOn average, we found the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 would recharge from empty to full in around two and a half hours.\n\nBut we do need to warn you that this device won\u2019t last you for a week on a full charge, as some devices from alternative companies such as Garmin or Fitbit are able to do. Instead, this is similar battery life to what you\u2019d expect from an Apple Watch.\n\nWe\u2019ve yet to test the 41mm variant of the Galaxy Watch 3, so we can\u2019t comment on the battery life of that model. There\u2019s a smaller247mAh cell inside that device, which suggests it may have poorer battery life, although there\u2019s less screen to power. We hope to test that device, and update this review with that information, soon.\n\nFor charging, you get a charging pad included in the box, and the device is also compatible with Qi wireless chargers if you want to get a couple more to place around your home or work. For the optimum charging performance, we\u2019d recommend using the charger in the box, but Qi pads will also work just fine.\n\nYou can also charge the device from certain recent Samsung phones too using the Wireless PowerShare feature. Just stick your smartwatch on the back of a compatible phone and it'll slowly juice up when you're in a pinch. We used this on the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, and we found it charged the Galaxy Watch 3, but it was nowhere near as fast as a Qi charger.\n\nShould I buy the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3?\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nBuy it if\u2026\n\nYou like the rotating bezel No other smartwatch manufacturer offers such a unique feature, and it\u2019s a fantastic way to interact with a wearable that allows you to see everything on the display while you cycle through menus. If you like that idea, this is the watch to get.\n\nYou want a great-looking smartwatch The Galaxy Watch 3 is a gorgeous-looking smartwatch, with a sharp and vivid display that can compete with all top-end devices. If you\u2019re buying a smartwatch for its looks, consider the Galaxy Watch 3.\n\nYou want a strong health companion In addition to being a great general-use watch, the Galaxy Watch 3 is full of fantastic health features, such as automatic tracking for workouts, and supports a huge variety of workouts. If you want both a smart wrist companion and a health tracker, this is it.\n\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026\n\nYou need long battery life The battery life on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 is okay considering some of the other devices it\u2019s competing with, but it won\u2019t last as long as some options from the likes of Fitbit or Garmin. If you want a long-lasting device, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nYou\u2019re looking for an affordable smartwatch This isn\u2019t the cheapest smartwatch on the market, and it\u2019s nowhere near the most affordable. In fact, if you want a similar device at a lower price you\u2019re still able to purchase the original Galaxy Watch.\n\nYou need certain health features right away The ECG monitor, blood pressure monitoring and SpO2 tracker aren\u2019t currently available in all markets on the Galaxy Watch 3. If you need these features from the get-go, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nAlso consider\n\nIf you've found that this Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 review hasn't tempted you, here are some other wearables to consider.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 4\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 is the successor to the Galaxy Watch 3. It has a faster chipset and runs Wear OS rather than Tizen, but the experience when using it will be somewhat similar. It's a definite upgrade overall, but with a higher price.\n\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 review\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic\n\nIf you want a big upgrade then consider the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, which has a premium design and all the other upgrades found on the Galaxy Watch 4.\n\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic review\n\nApple Watch 7\n\nIf you'd rather have something Apple then the Apple Watch 7 is a strong alternative. It's newer than the Galaxy Watch 3, so you could also consider the Apple Watch 6 instead, but that's harder to find as Apple has discontinued it.\n\nRead our full Apple Watch 7 review\n\nFirst reviewed: August 2020"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/technology\/tech-news-technology\/telegram-video-call-7-year-anniversary-6557084\/","domain":"indianexpress.com","published_date":"2020-08-16 10:20:02","title":"Telegram adds one-on-one video calling option on Android, iOS","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.indianexpress.com\/2020\/08\/Telegram-videocall.jpg?w=640","content":"To mark the seventh year anniversary, Telegram is rolling out a new update, the alpha version of the messaging platform which promises the video call feature.

While the ongoing coronavirus pandemic may affect Microsoft\u2019s exact launch date for the Xbox Series X, distributors seem to be getting ready for November 6th specifically.\n\nAn anonymous tipster, who recently purchased an unreleased Xbox Series X controller, sent me an image earlier this week of what is claimed to be the box that these controllers are stored in at distributors. The box specifically tells retail stores (that receive the shipments) not to sell or display the controllers until November 6th. Microsoft has used similar orange \u201cstreet date\u201d stickers on packages at its retail stores in the past, too.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear exactly how these controllers ended up on sale across Chicago over the weekend. The people selling these controllers have not responded to requests from The Verge about their origins, and those that have purchased them are none the wiser.\n\nSome people who have managed to purchase the controllers have registered them on Microsoft\u2019s support site only to find that the warranty expires on November 5th, 2021. If you calculate that in terms of end dates, it\u2019s exactly a year warranty after a November 6th release. Microsoft typically provides a 90-day warranty for individual controllers, so the company is either extending its warranty period here, or the system is working on the broader one year warranty that\u2019s associated with Xbox consoles.\n\nI asked Microsoft to explain the early appearance of Xbox Series X controllers on Monday but the company refused to comment. \u201cWe have a lot in store for Xbox in 2020 and can\u2019t wait to share with you,\u201d said a Microsoft spokesperson. \u201cHowever, we have nothing to announce at this time.\u201d Microsoft isn\u2019t commenting on the November 6th date, either."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"http:\/\/www.businesskorea.co.kr\/news\/articleView.html?idxno=50206","domain":"businesskorea.co.kr","published_date":"2020-08-10 03:16:51","title":"Samsung Retakes Top Spot in India's Mobile Phone Market","lang":"en","large_image_url":"http:\/\/www.businesskorea.co.kr\/news\/photo\/202008\/50206_62112_1544.png","content":"URL Copy(\uc73c)\ub85c \uae30\uc0ac\ubcf4\ub0b4\uae30 \ub9c1\ud06c\ub4dc\uc778(\uc73c)\ub85c \uae30\uc0ac\ubcf4\ub0b4\uae30 Send to Email Share Scrap"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/menafn.com\/1100602940\/Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Active2-gets-ECG-feature-in-South-Korea","domain":"menafn.com","published_date":"2020-08-08 06:43:25","title":"Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 gets ECG feature in South Korea","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/menafn.com\/updates\/pr\/2020-08\/08\/I_b582530b-bimage_story.jpg","content":"(MENAFN- IANS)\n\nSeoul, Aug 8 (IANS) has finally activated the ECG (electrocardiogram) functionality on Galaxy Watch Active2 in South Korea.\n\nThe company was supposed to make ECG and fall detection features available in the first quarter of this year but the plan was delayed.\n\nIn May this year, Samsung received clearance from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) for the ECG feature, reports SamMobile.\n\nUsers need to download and install the Samsung Monitor app on the watch and the paired to use ECG.\n\nThe ECG feature uses advanced sensor on the Galaxy Watch Active2, and will enable users to measure and analyze their heart rhythm for irregularities indicating Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\n\nTo measure the ECG, a user just needs to open the app and place his smartwatch arm on a flat surface, and then place his fingertip of the other hand on the top button of the smartwatch for about 30 seconds.\n\nUsers in the US may also get the feature soon, as Samsung received certification from FDA to release ECG function on Galaxy Watch3 and Galaxy Watch Active2.\n\nTaking on Apple Watch that is currently the best health wearable in the market, the newly-launched Samsung Galaxy Watch3 offers blood oxygen (SpO2) and fall detection tools, and would include blood pressure (BP) monitoring and ECG readings in markets where these features have been authorised.\n\nThe blood oxygen feature would measure and track oxygen saturation over time, for fitness and wellness purposes.\n\nGalaxy Watch3 will be home to the new Samsung Health Monitor app once launched, said the company.\n\nGalaxy Watch3 comes with a new feature that detects falls, which identifies a potential fall and can send an SOS notification to your chosen contacts, it added.\n\n--IANS\n\nwh\/na"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/8\/5\/21354933\/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-tablets-120hz-oled-price-specs-features","domain":"theverge.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 14:00:00","title":"Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S7 Plus tablet has a 120Hz OLED display and 5G","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/0x0:2040x1360\/2400x1600\/filters:focal(1005x857:1006x858):format(webp)\/cdn.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/21696117\/bfarsace_200803_4124_0015.jpg","content":"Android tablets may not be nearly as popular as Apple\u2019s iPad, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Samsung from continuing to dish out new models on a fairly regular basis. Today, the company is announcing its latest high-end Android tablets: the Galaxy Tab S7 and Tab S7 Plus. Both models will be available in silver, black, or bronze this fall for $649.99 and $849.99, respectively.\n\nLike the Tab S6 from last year, the Tab S7 and S7 Plus are meant to pull double duty as both content consumption devices and productivity machines. As a result, they both have optional keyboard cases available ($199.99 for the S7, $229.99 for the S7 Plus) that allow you to use them like a traditional laptop. Both models also come with Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus in the box, which magnetically attaches and charges on the back of the tablet.\n\nThe most noticeable difference between the Tab S7 and S7 Plus is their sizes: the S7 has an 11-inch display, while the S7 Plus has a 12.4-inch model. Look closer, and you\u2019ll spot other differences, like the fact that the Plus model has an OLED panel, while the S7 makes do with a more traditional LCD. Both run at 120Hz for smooth visuals, and both are larger than the 10.5-inch screen that was on the Tab S6. But they have a 16:10 aspect ratio, which makes them better suited for watching video than productivity, and both models have considerably smaller surface areas to work with compared to their iPad Pro counterparts.\n\nThe Tab S7 Plus\u2019s 120Hz OLED screen promises to be a stunner. (Earbuds aren\u2019t included.) Photo: Samsung\n\nAnother difference between the two is the Tab S7 Plus has an in-screen fingerprint scanner, while the Tab S7 has one built into its power button. Samsung has tweaked the design of the tablet as well, sharpening the edges and trimming down the S Pen to a sleeker cylinder.\n\nSamsung has given the internals an upgrade to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 865 Plus processor, 6 or 8GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of internal storage. (A microSD card slot is also available to expand the storage further.) Both models will be available in Wi-Fi or cellular versions, complete with millimeter-wave and sub-6 5G connectivity. Both have quad speakers with Dolby Atmos tuning and support up to 45-watt charging on their USB-C ports. Neither has a headphone jack, unfortunately.\n\nA magnetic strip on the back of the tablet provides a place to store and charge the included S Pen stylus. Photo: Samsung\n\nAs Android tablets, the Tab S7 pair both run Android 10 with Samsung\u2019s OneUI customization on top of it. They also support Samsung\u2019s DeX interface, which provides a more desktop-like experience when you\u2019re using a keyboard case. DeX, which has been around in various forms since the Galaxy S8 smartphone in 2017, has long been an interesting idea without the execution to back it up. We\u2019ll have to see if Samsung\u2019s improved it enough on the Tab S7 to see if it finally does live up to its promise. Samsung also says the Tab S7 can double as a secondary display for your Windows PC later this year.\n\nWe\u2019ll also have to see if Samsung\u2019s traditional strengths \u2014 great displays, excellent sound \u2014 are enough to justify the high cost of the Tab S7 and Tab S7 Plus. Last year\u2019s Tab S6 was a tough sell at $650, and now the company is asking even more money, at least for the larger model. They still aren\u2019t as expensive as Apple\u2019s iPad Pro models, and they come with the stylus in the box, which is an extra charge in Apple\u2019s world.

The feud has spread to include the popular Chinese-owned video app TikTok and China-based messaging service WeChat.\n\nWashington cut off Huawei's access to U.S. components and technology including Google's music and other smartphone services last year. Those penalties were tightened in May when the White House barred vendors worldwide from using U.S. technology to produce components for Huawei.\n\nProduction of Kirin chips designed by Huawei's own engineers will stop Sept. 15 because they are made by contractors that need U.S. manufacturing technology, said Richard Yu, president of the company's consumer unit. He said Huawei lacks the ability to make its own chips.\n\n\"This is a very big loss for us,\" Yu said Friday at an industry conference, China Info 100, according to a video recording of his comments posted on multiple websites.\n\n\"Unfortunately, in the second round of U.S. sanctions, our chip producers only accepted orders until May 15. Production will close on Sept. 15,\" Yu said. \"This year may be the last generation of Huawei Kirin high-end chips.\"\n\nMore broadly, Huawei's smartphone production has \"no chips and no supply,\" Yu said.\n\nYu said this year's smartphone sales probably will be lower than 2019's level of 240 million handsets but gave no details. The company didn't immediately respond to questions Saturday.\n\nHuawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, denies accusations it might facilitate Chinese spying. Chinese officials accuse Washington of using national security as an excuse to stop a competitor to U.S. tech industries.\n\nHuawei is a leader among emerging Chinese competitors in telecoms, electric cars, renewable energy and other fields in which the ruling Communist Party hopes China can become a global leader.\n\nHuawei has 180,000 employees and one of the world's biggest research and development budgets at more than $15 billion a year. But, like most global tech brands, it relies on contractors to manufacture its products.\n\nEarlier, Huawei announced its global sales rose 13.1% over a year ago to 454 billion yuan ($65 billion) in the first half of 2020. Yu said that was due to strong sales of high-end products but gave no details.\n\nHuawei became the world's top-selling smartphone brand in the three months ending in June, passing rival Samsung for the first time due to strong demand in China, according to Canalys. Sales abroad fell 27% from a year earlier.\n\nWashington also is lobbying European and other allies to exclude Huawei from planned next-generation networks as a security risk.\n\nIn other U.S.-Chinese clashes, TikTok's owner, ByteDance Ltd., is under White House pressure to sell the video app. That is due to fears its access to personal information about millions of American users might be a security risk.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ban on unspecified transactions with TikTok and the Chinese owner of WeChat, a popular messaging service."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/citizen.co.za\/motoring\/motoring-news-motoring\/2339025\/facelift-jaguar-f-type-re-priced-in-lieu-of-more-all-paw-gripping-models\/","domain":"citizen.co.za","published_date":"2020-08-11 10:49:00","title":"Facelift Jaguar F-Type re-priced in lieu of more all-paw gripping models","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/media.citizen.co.za\/assets\/img\/citizen.png","content":"Facelift Jaguar F-Type re-priced in lieu of more all-paw gripping models\n\nThe all-paw gripping P380 will get from 0-100 km\/h 5.1 seconds and top out at 275 km\/h.\n\nDespite announcing initial pricing for the updated F-Type Coupe and Cabriolet in December last year, Jaguar has now revised the sticker prices for both models to include the all-wheel-drive P380.\n\nWhile no changes to the actual specification has taken place, the main drawing card, as mentioned, is the availability of all-wheel-drive on the mid-range P380 previously only offered on the limited run First Edition.\n\nStill motivated by the 280kW\/460Nm 3.0-litre supercharged V6, the all-paw gripping P380 will get from 0-100 km\/h 5.1 seconds and top out at 275 km\/h, while the conventional rear-wheel-drive will reach the same top speed but complete the benchmark sprint in 4.9 seconds.\n\nElsewhere, the line-up is otherwise unchanged with the 2.0-litre turbocharged 221kW\/400Nm P300 serving as the entry-level model, while the 5.0-litre supercharged V8 R rates as the range\u2019s flagship with outputs of 423kW\/700Nm.

Touchless in-store device demos. Deals galore. Those are just some of the plans in Samsung's playbook for selling phones during a pandemic. Last week, the South Korean electronics giant unveiled the Galaxy Z Fold 2 alongside the $999 Note 20, the $1,299 Note 20 Ultra, the $649 Galaxy Tab S7 tablet, the $399 Galaxy Watch 3 and the $170 Galaxy Buds Live earbuds. Samsung has already begun taking preorders for the new Notes. Orders should arrive around Aug. 21.\n\nSamsung hasn't yet detailed pricing or availability for the Z Fold 2, but said it will share more information on Sept. 1. The first generation of the device cost $1,980 and came with 4G in the US. The new model packs in 5G connectivity across the three major US carriers, a glass screen and a redesigned hinge, all of which could make it even more expensive.\n\nSamsung, which recently lost its crown as the world's biggest phone maker to Huawei, is launching its new devices in a tough environment. Instead of facing a strong market for phones, with 5G and foldable screens getting people to upgrade their devices, most handset makers are seeing lower demand amid the raging coronavirus pandemic. Millions of people are out of work, hundreds of thousands have died and regions around the globe continue to battle a seemingly unending surge in infections. Consumers are opting for less expensive devices, saving their money altogether or spending their cash on PCs and other work-from-home and entertainment supplies.\n\nSamsung's task with its new lineup is finding buyers willing to fork over a grand or two during a pandemic and recession. The new products were designed before the novel coronavirus spread around the globe, which meant Samsung couldn't tweak the Note 20 or its other new devices to address the pandemic.\n\nWhat it could do, though, is change how it goes about selling the Note 20 and the Note 20 Ultra, Drew Blackard, vice president of product management for Samsung Electronics America, said in an interview ahead of the launch event.\n\n\"It was a bit more of how you react to the current situation as opposed to kind of retool everything that you're doing,\" Blackard said. \"Despite the fact that we couldn't change the device, we very much rethought how we go to market.\"\n\nWatch this: First Look: Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra 06:04\n\nThat includes those virtual consultations that'll make the online buying interaction more like the in-store experience. Touchless digital demos will give in-store shoppers a glimpse into the Note's features, right from their own devices. And Samsung is exploring ways to tailor its future products and services to the needs of people who are largely stuck at home, like making it easier to track fitness and stay healthy while quarantining.\n\nLower phone sales\n\nSamsung's phone sales have taken a hit during the pandemic. Its Galaxy S20 lineup became available about a week before parts of the US issued stay-at-home orders. Because consumers were worried about money -- and couldn't see the new devices in person -- demand fell. Last week, Samsung said its mobile business revenue tumbled 18% from the previous year.\n\nIn the second quarter, Apple was the only smartphone vendor that saw its shipments grow, according to Canalys. Apple's iPhone SE, its first major revamp of its popular small phone in four years, arrived in mid-April with a starting price of $399. That seemed to be the perfect phone for the times and helped buoy Apple's results. The device costs $300 less than the iPhone 11 but contains many of the same specs, appealing to people who can't afford a $700 phone, let alone a $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro .\n\nSamsung, despite launching its new Galaxy S20 lineup in March and its less expensive Galaxy A phones, saw the biggest year-over-year drop of the world's top five phone makers in the second quarter, Canalys said. Its 30% decline allowed Huawei to leapfrog Samsung to become the world's biggest smartphone vendor for the first time, the firm noted. It was the first time in nine years that a company other than Samsung or Apple shipped the most phones.\n\nSamsung said in a statement it'll continue to \"focus on creating innovative mobile experiences that improve our users' lives.\" Part of that includes its new devices from Unpacked, and it noted during its earnings in late July that it also will strengthen its \"mass-market lineup\" of less expensive phones.\n\nAt least in the US, Samsung \"found that, actually, demand for premium devices is still quite high,\" Blackard said. Still, Samsung sold about 44% fewer Galaxy S20 models in the US in the first four months of sales than the Galaxy S10 last year, according to M Science, a data analytics provider that tracks stats like mobile adoption.\n\nGoogle , meanwhile, unveiled its new smartphone, the Pixel 4A, last Monday. Instead of introducing a high-end, flagship phone, Google opted to slightly pare back the Pixel's specs to price it at $349. The phone doesn't have 5G or a premium processor, but \"for its price, the Pixel 4A has one of the best cameras you can get on a phone,\" CNET's Lynn La said in her review of the device.\n\nThe new Note 20 lineup is nowhere near that price level, with phones starting at $1,000. For some people at this time, that pricing could be hard to stomach. Working in Samsung's favor is the rabid Note fanbase.\n\n\"What we've shown here in the past five months is we probably have the broadest portfolio of any company in the industry,\" Blackard said. \"We are down to $99 on the A01, up to Galaxy Fold , which is [about] $2,000. ... Our portfolio is very well suited to the current situation.\"\n\nStill, the new Note lineup has a lot in common with the Galaxy S20 devices from earlier this year. In the past, the Note got the latest and greatest technology first, and it also had the biggest screen. Now the Galaxy S lineup gets a lot of features first, and the foldables are Samsung's new ultra-premium lineup. There've been questions for years about where the Note fits into Samsung's overall lineup.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see whether this will be the last evolution of the Note in its current format,\" said CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood. \"These days consumers tend to hold onto their smartphones for at least three years, so having two flagship launches a year may no longer be necessary.\"\n\nEncouraging online shopping\n\nA big focus for Samsung during the pandemic is boosting online phone sales, something that hasn't been a huge market in the US. Here, most people buy their phones from carriers like Verizon and AT&T , and they usually at least look at them in person before making the purchase. But the pandemic has forced many stores around the country to close, preventing people from holding new phones in their hands before buying them.\n\n\"People shop on their phones, but they don't shop for phones with their phones,\" Blackard said.\n\nTo make people more comfortable with buying smartphones online, Samsung started offering contactless delivery and increased the return window for its devices to 30 days from 14. It also created a first responders discount for all of its products, which is on par with Samsung's employee discount.\n\nWatch this: Samsung Unpacked showcases new devices, partnerships 02:16\n\nSince the pandemic began, the amount of US purchases made online across the phone industry has almost doubled compared with in-store, Blackard said.\n\nSamsung also will be offering virtual consultations starting this month, providing information that would-be buyers typically get when they go into physical stores -- like detailing features of a device, explaining their phone plan and potential deals for the phone and answering questions.\n\n\"From your computer, you'll be able to just log in, and you'll get a Samsung representative who can walk you through that purchase process as if you were there in a retail store,\" Blackard said. He added that while the consultants initially will be Samsung employees, the company hopes to partner with others, like carriers, to provide the same sort of experience.\n\nChanging the in-store experience\n\nFor stores that are open, Samsung is rolling out a new \"touchless digital retail mode\" with the Note 20, Blackard said. Typically, people visiting stores pick up new devices and play with them before deciding to buy. Samsung's technology will let people scan a QR code using their own devices and launch \"a virtual experience of what it's like to use the Note 20 on the device you have in your hand,\" he said.\n\n\"People might not want to touch a phone right now as they go into a store,\" Blackard said.\n\nSamsung's new Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra come in a striking bronze shade +23 More See all photos\n\nSamsung also knows it has to make its devices more attractively priced for consumers. After introducing the Galaxy S20 in March, Samsung offered \"work from home bundles\" that gave deals on equipment. And last month, it partnered with Postmates to give anyone who bought certain Galaxy devices a free year of Postmates Unlimited, the service that gives free delivery on orders.\n\nThough the new Note lineup doesn't come cheap, Samsung plans to offer generous promotional deals for the phones. Note 20 buyers will get $100 Samsung.com gift cards, while Note 20 Ultra purchasers will get $150. Samsung also has trade-in offers to give up to $650 for older devices, and it's expanded its upgrade program, which lets device owners get a new Galaxy phone every year.\n\nAnd Samsung on Wednesday detailed a new partnership with Microsoft for a gaming bundle that includes three free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and a Bluetooth controller. The two companies also have worked to bring Android apps to Windows and include other productivity features in Samsung mobile devices, something that's attracted more buyers and could appeal to people who are working from home.\n\n\"The Note occupies an evolving space in Samsung's lineup,\" Reticle Research principal analyst Ross Rubin said. \"Samsung has shifted it toward productivity enthusiasts.\"\n\nFuture products\n\nHuawei , which sells most of its devices in its home country of China, has already made some design tweaks to its phones, like adding a temperature sensor to its Honor Play 4 Pro so the smartphone can work as a thermometer.\n\nSamsung isn't ready to talk about changes to its devices, Blackard said, but it's looking at three broad areas for innovation: fitness and health; shopping; and entertainment.\n\nThe areas \"are very exploratory,\" Blackard said. Samsung won't be deploying new services or features immediately but considers them \"areas of investigation and product collaboration to bring these solutions to market.\"\n\nWhen it comes to fitness, Samsung is exploring tools to help people \"figure out ways to exercise from home,\" Blackard said. For health, Samsung is looking into features to support telehealth, those digital doctor appointments more people are having during the pandemic.\n\n\"How do we dive deeper with consumers on some of the things that they're going through and then ultimately craft solutions around that?\" Blackard said.\n\nWhen it comes to retail, Samsung is exploring ways to improve the online shopping experience. \"Considering all the technology we have in these [new Note] devices -- 5G connectivity, great augmented reality solutions, three cameras -- the mobile shopping experience is still pretty basic,\" Blackard said.\n\nAnd with entertainment, Samsung is considering how it can help people enjoy concerts, sports, movies and other content from home instead of in person. Rather than create its own services -- something Samsung has struggled with -- it's opted to partner with other companies over the past several years, like working with Microsoft to offer Xbox Cloud gaming on the Note 20. It's looking at even more ways to work with partners in entertainment, Blackard said."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/samsung-credit-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-bundle-xcloud-cloud-gaming-145756632.html","domain":"engadget.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 15:40:28","title":"Samsung will offer an Xbox Game Pass Bundle with the Note 20","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/ny\/api\/res\/1.2\/SkAFDBKhoAt9jCzNbPjgqg--\/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU3OA--\/https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2020-08\/f928f8d0-d732-11ea-bb9f-27615a9858f7","content":"Cloud gaming is coming to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on September 15th, and mobile users will be able to play dozens of Xbox One and Xbox Series X games through xCloud over data connections.

The Huawei P40 Pro+ has an insane\n\nThe rear of the phone features a substantial bump but if you use a case, it\u2019ll likely become flush with the back of the phone. This camera module is shaped in a way to look like a smaller phone, clinging to the back of the phone like a koala bear does to its mother. In 2020, there are all sorts of different approaches to the layout of cameras on the rear of phones and regardless of whether its the same aspect ratio as the phone is not particularly important, what the cameras offer, absolutely is.\n\nRear Camera\n\nThe headline feature is likely to be 100x SuperZoom Array. This is really impressive and can certainly achieve pretty great quality photos of objects far in the distance, of course once you go past 30x, then 50x and right out to 100x, you\u2019re well into the digital zoom section of the hybrid zoom, so wherever possible, stick with the optical.\n\nThat said, the camera features a 50 MP Ultra Vision Camera (Wide Angle, f\/1.9 aperture, OIS) and 40 MP Cine Camera (Ultra-Wide Angle, f\/1.8 aperture) as well as an 8 MP SuperZoom Camera (10x Optical Zoom, f\/4.4 aperture, OIS), an 8 MP Telephoto Camera (3x Optical Zoom, f\/2.4 aperture, OIS) and finally a 3D Depth Sensing Camera.\n\nThis camera system is capable of capturing photos in resolutions up to 8192 x 6144 pixels. With that level of quality, digital zoom and ultimately cropping, still creates an amazing photo.\n\nWhen it comes to video, the P40 Pro+ can record in 4K (3840 x 2160 pixels) at 60fps video. This means amazing quality and buttery smooth motion.\n\nThe camera also features fast Autofocus and Image stabilization to help you capture the best photo the first time.\n\nFront Camera\n\nTurning our attention to the front, there\u2019s a seriously impressive 32 MP Selfie Camera (f\/2.2 aperture) which combines with a Depth Camera to offer face unlock support (even at night).\n\nTraditionally front-facing cameras were an afterthought, but now with video calling (and TikTok) being so popular, it\u2019s becoming a real must-have feature to have great front-facing cameras.\n\nThe P40 Pro+ delivers with support for 4K 60fps video recording, yes, front the front camera, that\u2019s insane.

The addition of Linux support opened the doors for Android Studio with some limitations and now perhaps the biggest one is gone. Google announced support for the Android Emulator with Android Studio on certain Chromebooks, with more to follow:\n\nSupported Chromebooks can now run a full version of the Android Emulator, which allows developers to test apps on any Android version and device without needing the actual hardware. Android app developers can simulate map locations and other sensor data to test how an app performs with various motions, orientations, and environmental conditions. With the Android Emulator support in Chrome OS, developers can optimize for different Android versions and devices \u2014 including tablets and foldable smartphones \u2014 right from their Chromebook.\n\nThis news came by way of another announcement, a new Google site called ChromeOS.dev, which as you can likely guess, is about development on Chromebooks.\n\nDevelopers could already code their Android apps on a Chromebook and even deploy them to a connected phone or tablet, or within the Android container of Chrome OS.\n\nBut that\u2019s only half the battle when writing mobile apps that will be used a wide range of devices, each with different screen sizes, pixel densities, and hardware features such as GPS radios or dual-displays and folding screens. Hence the need for a device emulator to test different device scenarios.\n\nAccording to Google, the following Chromebooks initially support Android emulation in Android Studio:\n\nAcer: Chromebook 712 [C871]\n\nChromebook 712 [C871] ASUS: Chromebook Flip C436FA\n\nChromebook Flip C436FA Dell: Latitude 5300 2-in-1 Chromebook Enterprise, Latitude 5400 Chromebook Enterprise\n\nLatitude 5300 2-in-1 Chromebook Enterprise, Latitude 5400 Chromebook Enterprise HP: Chromebook x360 14c\n\nChromebook x360 14c Lenovo: Flex 5 Chromebook\n\nEven though my device isn\u2019t on that list, I installed the latest version of Android Studio on my daily driver, the Acer Chromebook Spin 13 with 16 GB of memory. I made sure during a custom installation that I saw the Android Emulator component was there.\n\nUnfortunately, Google seems to be rolling this feature out on a limited basis to just the officially supported devices right now. I couldn\u2019t create a virtual Android device for emulation on my Acer, which is more than powerful enough to handle it.\n\nIndeed, I\u2019m surprised the Lenovo Chromebook Flex 5 is on the list because there are various configurations of that device, such as the $409 model with Intel Core i3 and 4 GB of memory as well as the less expensive models running on a Celeron.\n\nRegardless, any steps forward here are progress. I\u2019d think that after gathering some data and optimizing the emulator further, this feature will become more widely available on mid- to high-end Chromebooks in the coming months.\n\nShare this: Mastodon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\n"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.co.za\/google-launches-nearby-share-android-apple-airdrop-alternative-2020-8","domain":"businessinsider.co.za","published_date":"2020-08-05 06:35:45","title":"Google is quietly bringing one of the iPhone's most-wanted features to Android","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/6716696801ea6d83dee2b63e?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp","content":"By clicking \u201cSign Up\u201d, you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

Our initial hiccups with range proved to be just that and we were more or less sold on them right out of the gate. If anything, they've gotten better over time. It's hard to imagine life without them, now. Battery life 8\n\nPrice 8\n\nFeatures 8\n\nUser Ratings ( 1 Votes) 10\n\nThey say that first impressions last but that\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes you get a phone that seems great initially, but the battery doesn\u2019t last for the whole day. Perhaps you go on a date and then later find out they like pineapple on pizza. Maybe it\u2019s a new job that seems great but they won\u2019t pay you unless you turn up every day. It\u2019s always something, right?\n\nWhich brings us to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds Live in-ear headphones, which left us with a very favourable impression when we first got them out of the box. After using them for nearly two weeks, what have Samsung\u2019s newest \u2018buds done to make that first impression a true one?\n\nDr. Robotnik\u2019s Mean Bean Machine\n\nOne thing they haven\u2019t done at all is change shape. They\u2019re still in a sturdy lozenge-shaped charging case, which\u2019ll wirelessly top up your buds if you happen to have a charge pad (and it\u2019ll go faster if you connect a USB-C cable). The buds themselves are still shaped like cute little beans moulded from high-quality plastic. There\u2019s a little foot on one end of the buds to keep them in your ears and there\u2019s a spare set in the box in case you somehow lose one.\n\nThe buds are well designed for sitting in your ear-holes for extended periods. The smooth plastic doesn\u2019t jam into your ear tight enough to cause that sweaty, gunky feeling and the speaker grilles in the bit that fits in your ear are perfectly positioned to deliver excellent sound right to your eardrums. Nothing we encountered over time lessened our opinion of the Galaxy Buds Live at all \u2014 if anything, they\u2019ve gotten better in our estimation. They\u2019ve displaced all our other in-ears for the time being.\n\nPower-up\n\nThe Galaxy Buds Live have a claimed uptime of six hours between charges, with a possible total of 22 hours on a single full charge (buds + case). That\u2019s not far off from our real-world testing. We didn\u2019t sit with a stopwatch at all but got more than five hours of the buds in a single session. Odds are they\u2019ll return to the case more often than we sent them back and Samsung\u2019s top-up is speedy. Five minutes in the case\u2019ll net you another hour (from empty), so it\u2019s quite possible to go the entire day without running out of battery. Just\u2026 stick them in the case while you make your coffee or something.\n\n22 hours isn\u2019t fantastic, as buds go \u2014 there are larger case batteries out there but they\u2019re not packing Samsung\u2019s fantastic buds. Beyond the numbers, though, the charge in these earbuds is good enough that we often forgot they needed charging. Samsung frequently had to notify us that they required topping up via an actual charger. But that\u2019s because we were far too busy just being immersed in audio.\n\nSounds like a good time\n\nIs that first impression of the Buds Live as easy on the ears? Yeah, that never went away. Comfort wasn\u2019t the only reason these headphones took over everyday listening duties. The Galaxy Buds+ are decent enough but they\u2019re officially obsolete. Our Jabra Elite 85H cans are also excellent but they were also retired for the duration of the review \u2014 Samsung\u2019s buds are better multifunction headphones. Excellent for online meetings and voice calls alike, they pipe audio directly into your ears and ensuring you never miss a thing (unless, like Brad Lang, you mumble absolutely everything). For pure audio we\u2019d stick with the Jabra 85Hs\u2019 (better noise cancelling, there) but when switching roles throughout a workday, Samsung\u2019s buds are a winner.\n\nWe absolutely love how they handle music. The other stuff, like crystal clear mics, noise cancelling, a comfortable fit and lengthy battery life, is all decent enough when taken alone but the way the Buds Live make our usual playlists sound\u2026 that\u2019s enough to tie the R4,000 price point together for us. Yes, dedicated audiophile headphones will sound better but for wireless in-ears, Samsung holds up its end with aplomb. Clear across the board, no matter which sub-genre of heavy metal we threw at them, with mids and highs distinctly separate and without an overbearing bass (unless you explicitly want it \u2014 there\u2019s a setting for that), the audio experience is the best thing about these buds.\n\nYou might recall we did have one complaint when setting the Galaxy Buds Live up initially \u2014 that\u2019d be: range, or lack thereof. That issue\u2019s cleared right up. Whether that means Samsung\u2019s finished using the Galaxy Buds Live to map the walls of our test environment or just that the update we were expecting came through while we were asleep, we noted a gradual lessening of range dropout until the expected 10 metres is now standard.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Buds Live Verdict\n\nSamsung gives Galaxy Note 20 pre-orders a R4,000 voucher to spend on the new Samsung Online Store in South Africa (until 23 August, anyways) \u2014 which is just enough to get you a set of Galaxy Buds Live. If you\u2019re buying the phone anyway, we\u2019d definitely suggest spending the funds on a set of these. And if you\u2019re just looking for a new set of wireless in-ears, these are Samsung\u2019s best efforts yet. Sony might have them beat in terms of pure audio with the WF-1000XM3s (and their upcoming successors) but they\u2019re a pricier proposition. If you\u2019ve got a Samsung smartphone, these are a great bet \u2014 particularly in a work-from-home environment where you want multi-role buds you can wear all day that also sound great."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/observer.com\/2020\/08\/spacex-job-posting-plan-texas-boca-chica-launch-resort\/","domain":"observer.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 16:14:57","title":"Is SpaceX Turning Its Texas Launch Site Into a Themed Luxury Resort?","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/observer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2020\/08\/GettyImages-539719466.jpg?quality=80&w=970","content":"Elon Musk\u2018s SpaceX is used to looking up at the stars, but its latest project is more firmly planted here on Earth.

As MacRumors reports, the latest information coming from sources within Apple's supply chain suggest we're going to see the two 6.1-inch models launch first, followed by the 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch models at a later date. By taking that decision now, Apple will be able to prioritize supply of the 6.1-inch models to cope with early demand, then ramp up production on the other models later on.\n\nAs to how much time Apple intends to wait between the two launches, it's thought mainboards for the 6.1-inch devices have started shipping recently, with the second stage devices shipping in late August. If that holds true, it could therefore be a month between the first and second launch windows for the iPhone 12.\n\nWith the iPhone 12 launch delayed by a few weeks and now expected in mid to late October, consumers may not be able to get their hands on the 5.4-inch and 6.7-inch models until late November. That still allows ample time for pre-Christmas sales, which must be high up on the list of concerns for Apple. However, it seems like supply more than demand will be the constraint for the company, regardless of which model proves the most popular.\n\nFollow Mashable SEA on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/mobilesyrup.com\/2020\/08\/10\/qualcomm-huawei-chips-sale-us-ban\/","domain":"mobilesyrup.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 14:38:00","title":"Qualcomm reportedly wants US to let it sell Snapdragon chips to Huawei","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.mobilesyrup.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/qualcomm-logo-header-resizzled-scaled.jpg","content":"Qualcomm reportedly wants the Trump administration to allow sales of its Snapdragon mobile chips to Huawei.\n\nThe report comes from the Wall Street Journal (via 9to5Google) and follows Huawei\u2019s recent confirmation that it would no longer use it\u2019s in-house Kirin processors. Due to the U.S. ban on the China-based phone maker, Huawei\u2019s contractors will no longer take orders to build Kirin chips.\n\nAccording to the WSJ, Qualcomm wants Trump to lift certain restrictions on Huawei so it can provide the company with 5G chipsets. Further, the WSJ indicated Qualcomm wants to take advantage of potential \u201c$8 billion\u201d USD (about $10.7 billion CAD) in orders from Huawei. Along with that, a Qualcomm deal could prevent \u201ctwo foreign competitors\u201d from getting the contract instead. Those competitors are likely MediaTek and Samsung.\n\nAt the core, Qualcomm argues that the U.S. government should exempt Qualcomm from parts of the Huawei ban since it would potentially allow a massive deal between the two companies and help the U.S.-based chipmaker develop new technology.\n\nThe U.S. ban on Huawei placed the company on an \u2018entity list.\u2019 Any U.S. company, or companies that use U.S. components, must get a special licence from the government to sell to Huawei and other companies on the entity list.\n\nWhile there\u2019s certainly an opportunity here for Qualcomm if it convinces the U.S. to exempt it from some ban restrictions, I doubt the company would land a deal with Huawei.\n\nHuawei already works with MediaTek on chipsets for its Honor sub-brand, so there may be precedent for the two to work together for Huawei phones too. Samsung\u2019s Exynos chips could also be an option. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Huawei ramp up an entirely in-house chip too. Arguably the main benefit of going with Qualcomm chips would be that they\u2019re better liked in North America. Considering how many currently view Huawei, I\u2019m not sure that benefit would carry much weight.\n\nSource: WSJ Via: 9to5Google"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/03\/apple-led-q2-tablet-shipments\/","domain":"9to5mac.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 19:34:00","title":"Report: Apple led global Q2 tablet shipments with 14 million iPads","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/wp-content\/client-mu-plugins\/9to5-core\/includes\/obfuscate-images\/images\/9to5mac-default.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1600","content":"Apple posted record results for the June quarter which sent its stock price soaring.

With this, Google is essentially turning your Android phone into a seismometer to create what the company says is \u201cthe world\u2019s largest earthquake detection network.\u201d\n\nThe company argues that smartphone accelerometers are sensitive enough to measure the P-waves that are the first waves to arrive after an earthquake. Whenever the phone thinks it has detected an earthquake, it will send that info to a central server, which then determines whether this was really an earthquake. For now, Google will only use this data to show information when somebody then searches for \u201cearthquake\u201d or a similar keyword. Over time, though, it expects to be able to send out alerts based on these phone-based systems.\n\nIn California, the company is already going a step further, though. Working with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and California Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), Google is using the ShakeAlert network \u2014 which itself uses data from 700 seismometers from across the state \u2014 to provide earthquake alerts. \u201cA few seconds of warning can make a difference in giving you time to drop, cover, and hold on before the shaking arrives,\u201d Google argues."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/uk.motor1.com\/news\/439317\/2021-ford-gt-heritage-edition-official\/","domain":"uk.motor1.com","published_date":"2020-08-17 07:00:00","title":"2021 Ford GT Heritage Edition celebrates Ken Miles' 1966 Daytona win","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.motor1.com\/images\/mgl\/Oppee\/s3\/2021-ford-gt-heritage-edition-front-quarter-beauty.jpg","content":"Hide press release Show press release\n\nFirst-Ever Ford GT Heritage Edition to Celebrate Storied \u201966 Daytona Win, Plus 2021 Studio Collection Graphics Package\n\nFord Performance unveils new Ford GT Heritage Edition inspired by the 1966 Daytona 24 Hour Continental, a stylish Frozen White with exposed carbon fiber and Race Red livery that pays homage to the 55th anniversary of the epic race where Ford achieved its first 24-hour endurance win\n\nExclusive Ford GT Studio Collection offers even more exclusivity with unique and widely customizable design features in a limited-availability package for only 40 Ford GT supercars slated for production across the 2021 and 2022 model years\n\nNew 2021 Ford GT Heritage Edition and Studio Collection are the pinnacle of Petersen Car Week, which started airing Wednesday on the Petersen Museum\u2019s YouTube channel; highlights include several virtual events featuring 25 hours of original content from manufacturers and enthusiasts, plus automotive lifestyle and auction house activities\n\nDEARBORN, Mich., Aug. 16, 2020 \u2013 The Ford GT is America\u2019s only Le Mans-winning supercar, and taking this pinnacle of Ford Performance even further for 2021, Ford is revealing two new enhancements today \u2013 the first-ever Heritage Edition inspired by the original model\u2019s first endurance win at the 1966 Daytona 24 Hour Continental race, plus an all-new Studio Collection package offers even more exclusivity and design enhancements.\n\n\u201cFor this Heritage Edition, the Ford Performance team went deeper into the Ford GT\u2019s race history and crafted a limited-edition model that stylistically honors the 55th anniversary of the Daytona 24 Hour endurance race that would eventually lead to our successes at Le Mans,\u201d said Mike Severson, Ford GT program manager. \u201cPlus, for customers who want to highlight the carbon-fiber body and functional cooling ducts that help deliver Le Mans-winning performance, the Ford GT Studio Collection offers another new way GT fans can personalize their supercars.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of two new variants of the Ford GT were the highlights at the conclusion of 2020 Petersen Car Week, which started airing Wednesday on the museum\u2019s YouTube channel.

It allows any two Android phones, running Android 6.0 or above, to quickly share files between each other. The feature is similar to Apple's AirDrop file sharing platform and after years of rumours and leaks, Google is officially rolling it out. For now, only select Google Pixel and Samsung phones are said to be compatible, although Google doesn't specify what these phones are. More smartphones should receive support for Nearby Share in the coming weeks. The feature will also be compatible with Chromebooks, in the coming months.\n\nPreviously rumoured to be called Fast Share, the feature was discovered earlier this year, hidden within Android 10's code. Nearby Share works in a similar fashion as AirDrop on Apple devices, where you select the file you want to share, choose \u2018Nearby Share' and wait for compatible phones near you, to show up in your screen. After that, you simply tap the device name you wish to share it too, and away it goes. The receiver will still have the option to accept or decline the file, so you don't receive files by accident. Google says that the Nearby Share feature will automatically choose the best protocol for sending the files that could be Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, WebRTC, or peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. This will allow you to send files even when you're offline.\n\nSimilar to AirDrop, you'll be able to customise your phone's visibility to other devices around you. You'll have the option to choose from 'Hidden,' 'Some contacts,' or 'All contacts.' Google also mentions in its blog post that you'll be able send and receive files anonymously too, meaning you won't have to add someone to your contacts for a one-time transfer.\n\nFor now, Nearby Sharing only works with Google's products that are Android phones and soon, Chromebooks. You won't be able to share files to iPhone models, macOS devices, or Windows devices; however, these platforms could be supported in the future, going by what a Google's spokesperson told The Verge.\n\nIs Nord the iPhone SE of the OnePlus world?

Available in three colors: mystic white, black and bronze, they certainly look flashy, with a chrome-like finish that you can see your reflection in.\n\nAt $170 (\u00a3179, AU$319), they cost slightly more than the standard Apple AirPods. And like the AirPods, they have an open design -- you don't jam an ear tip into your ear -- and they're quite comfortable to wear. Additionally, they're really discreet and basically sit flush with your ear without a little white pipe extending out from them. And finally, they feature active noise canceling. More about that in a minute.\n\nThe Galaxy Buds Live in mystic bronze. David Carnoy\/CNET\n\nI took one look at the bud and my first instinct was to put the part with rubber ring in my ear. But it's actually the opposite. You stick the other side -- the one with the little speaker and bass port -- in your ear facing downward and wedge the rest of the bean in your ear at an angle.\n\nRead more: Best true wireless noise-canceling earbuds\n\nSamsung shows you just how they're supposed to go in your ears in an animation that you can find in the Buds Live's companion apps -- it's the Galaxy Buds app for iOS, but Galaxy Wear for Android. The way they were sitting in my ears at less of an angle than in the animation appeared to be wrong. But that's how they fit in my ears -- and they did fit well -- so I just left them that way. For better or worse, I think you have to go with what the shape of your ear gives you. I did manage to get the speaker side of the ear tip to dip into my ear canal, which seemed like the most important thing.\n\nThat aforementioned rubber ring -- small and large versions are included in the box -- takes the place of wingtips that would ordinarily anchor these sort of earbuds. I used the larger of the two, and the earbuds just nestled nicely and securely in my ears with just enough added traction to keep them in place. That said, I wouldn't have minded if Samsung had included a more traditional sport wing that would really lock the buds in your ears.\n\nThey did stay in my ears more securely than the standard AirPods (the standard AirPods slip out of my ears if I run or even walk briskly with them). I was able to run and bike with the Galaxy Buds Live and while they only have IPX2 water-resistance, which makes them splash-resistant from certain angles, they are sweat-resistant and you can use them for working out. The earlier Galaxy Buds Plus are also IPX2 water-resistant, while the AirPods Pro are IPX4 rated (splashproof) and the standard AirPods have no water-resistance rating though people still run -- and sweat -- with them.\n\nEnlarge Image The flip side of the bud looks like a cartoon character. David Carnoy\/CNET\n\nI really liked the Galaxy Buds Plus, which have a noise-isolating design (meaning, they push into your ear canal). They also fit me well and I thought they sounded really good for the money. I figured that when Samsung did noise-canceling earbuds, it would make something very similar to the Buds Plus and add noise canceling and call them the Buds Pro or something like that.\n\nBut instead it's these Buds Live earbuds that have the active noise canceling. Samsung calls it \"ANC for Open Type.\" I can't say it's all that effective, however. There have been a few earbuds that have an open or semi-open design that have noise canceling but I've always found that you need a really tight seal to have noise canceling really work.\n\nEnlarge Image They're IPX2 water-resistant, so you can work out in them. David Carnoy\/CNET\n\nThese are supposed to reduce some noise in the lower frequencies, and Samsung talks about them blocking sound while riding on a train or bus. But I just didn't feel they made a big impact on reducing ambient noise. It's pretty mild. They do help a bit, allowing you to hear your music and make voice calls a little better in noisy environments. But the AirPods Pro, Sony WF-1000XM3, Technics EAH-AZ70W, Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 and several other noise-isolation true wireless earbuds that have active noise canceling do a significantly better job reducing ambient sound. So don't buy these for noise canceling or you may be disappointed. On the flip side, if you're someone's who's sensitive to active noise canceling -- some folks experience uncomfortable pressure on their eardrums -- these shouldn't bother you.\n\nLike the Galaxy Buds Plus, I did like how these sounded. No surprise, they do sound open -- and that's where the Live name comes from (it's supposed to give you the feel of a live concert, Samsung says). Their open, airy sound doesn't feel like it's stuck in your head. They've got 12mm drivers and a big bass port. The bass is plump yet punchy, which is how I like it -- and there's nice detail in the mids and highs. They're certainly lively-sounding. Dynamic is the word I usually use to describe headphones like these.\n\nEnlarge Image The three color options. Samsung\n\nSoundwise, these aren't quite there with the best-sounding true wireless earbuds like Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 2 or Sony's WF-1000XM3. But they're really solid and pleasant to listen to. And you can make some sound tweaks in the Galaxy Buds companion app for iOS and Android using the preset EQ settings. I mainly stuck to the default \"Normal\" mode.\n\nI did notice that the bass rolls off a little bit at higher volumes and things don't sound quite as well defined when you push the volume all the way up, especially if you're listening to a track with a lot of instruments playing at once. While that tends to be par for the course for Bluetooth earbuds, with most noise-isolating earbuds you can keep the volume at 80% or less. But because these are open, I had a tendency to push the volume to compete with any ambient sound.\n\nEnlarge Image They barely stick out of your ears though they are flashy. David Carnoy\/CNET\n\nAs for extra features, Galaxy device owners get a few options not available to Apple and non-Samsung Android users. That's not surprising since AirPods partially exist to help sell more iPhones. So it shouldn't shock anyone that Samsung would have some special features for its users.\n\nIf you own a Galaxy phone or tablet, you get a couple of extra features, including a low-latency gaming mode. That was available for the Galaxy Buds Plus under the \"Labs\" section of the app but it's been improved, according to a Samsung spokesperson, and will come in handy for Galaxy Note 20 users who want to play Xbox games from the cloud. Galaxy owners can also use Bixby, Samsung's voice assistant, hands-free without using the Buds' touch controls, which do work well and are responsive. Activate it by saying, \"Hi, Bixby.\" That's similar to the hands-free option for Siri for AirPods.\n\nIf you use hands-free Bixby, you lose a little bit of battery life. These are rated at up to 8 hours with noise canceling off and 6 hours with it on. It drops to 5.5 with noise canceling with Bixby always there, waiting for you to wake it up. The compact case charges wirelessly or via USB-C and gives you about 2.5 extra charges.\n\nWatch this: Galaxy Buds Live are the most innovative true wireless headphones of 2020 06:34\n\nBluetooth pairing is pretty flexible, depending on which devices you're using. If you have multiple Galaxy devices, you can pair them all to the buds and automatically switch between devices as long as they all are under the same Samsung account. iOS and Android users can pair the buds to multiple devices but you have to manually switch between them. They don't seem to pair simultaneously to two devices, but one of the newer Galaxy devices can simultaneously pair with two pairs of Buds Live. Windows 10 users can use Microsoft Swift pair to link these to their PCs. Mac users just have to put the buds into pairing mode to do the same (you tap and hold each bud simultaneously for a few seconds to go into pairing mode).\n\nThe Galaxy Buds Plus did a good job of reducing background noise when I was making calls with them and these do, too. There are two microphones on the outside of each bud and one on the inside and while the buds don't completely muffle sound around you, they do a good job of tamping down ambient noise and also picking up your voice. People I spoke with said they could hear me well even when I had street noise playing pretty loudly in the background from a YouTube feed (I'm not in New York City these days so I have to simulate street noise). You can use a single bud for making calls.\n\nI've spent a lot of time talking about the sound and the features of these earbuds, but it's really their design that's the standout feature. I get a lot of these types of earbuds in for review and this is the first one in a while that I thought was really innovative and different. They're pretty unique-looking, discreet and not only do they fit securely but they're comfortable to wear for long periods. Alas, the noise canceling isn't what I hoped it would be, but it is a challenge to do with open earbuds like these. Even so, they're easily among the best earbuds of 2020.\n\nFirst published Aug. 6."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/life-style\/science-technology\/1321526\/Google-Chrome-Incognito-Mode-Change-Hide-Browser-Activity","domain":"express.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-13 08:53:38","title":"Google Chrome tweaks Incognito Mode to make it faster to hide your online activity","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.images.express.co.uk\/img\/dynamic\/59\/590x\/Google-Chrome-Update-Launch-Faster-1321526.jpg?r=1597387865833","content":"Google Chrome users will be able to launch the privacy-focused mode much, much faster\n\nGoogle is making a drastic change to its immensely popular Chrome browser to make it faster to jump into an Incognito Mode browsing session.

Not great, but not terrible either. I'll probably still keep my pre-order and use it to fill the time between release and next-gen, just bc I've been waiting for an Avengers game for so long (though if I didn't like Marvel that much, I'd probably be waiting to get the game).\n\nWhile the controls are largely the same as something like the Arkham series or Spider-Man, I did think there was a lot more variety to combat than what they'd shown in the gameplay demos. Each character felt unique and was fun to play as. The field of view is way too tight though, and it creates some problems with tracking enemies and locating\/helping allies.\n\nStory missions and major side missions seem like they'll be decent at minimum, and I could see them having some HUGE boss fights planned. But beyond that, the other smaller side missions that make up most of the beta after the story content and which I suspect were\/are indicative of the live service aspect of the game sucked. They lacked life and were repetitive, leaving me concerned for the game's longevity beyond when new story content gets released.\n\nMatchmaking with other people seems like it's in need of work, even if I understand none of the quickplay options were made available. The AI companions are ok\/useful in battle and always revive you, but are otherwise useless for the most part. I'm not a fan of the fact that you always have to have companions for content outside of the main campaign, even if they're all AI.\n\nI did not feel like the gear system is as confusing as some have made it out to be, but I also recognize a lot of people will not like it. The layout of the menus, however, is kind of a mess.\n\nThe monetization is about what I expected. While I don't like it or want to see it in my games, I'll at least give be them credit for not packaging skins and nameplates in loot boxes where you only have a chance at getting them.\n\nOverall, I guess I am hoping that they let us play another piece of story content or two during one of the next two beta sessions, as that seems like what will make or break this game, along with the endgame (which I'm sure people would like some remotely vague details on at minimum) and whether they can make the needed improvements to combat, like adjusting the field of view."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/08\/07\/download-the-new-carplay-wallpapers-for-your-devices-right-here\/","domain":"9to5mac.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 23:19:00","title":"Download the new CarPlay wallpapers for your devices right here","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/wp-content\/client-mu-plugins\/9to5-core\/includes\/obfuscate-images\/images\/9to5mac-default.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1600","content":"In addition to all the new features of iOS 14, the update also includes CarPlay wallpapers for the first time.

Find out more about how we test.\n\nTwo minute review\n\nThis Google Pixel 4a review was written when the phone was new; since then, we've seen the Pixel 5 and Pixel 6 generations, as well as the Pixel 5a and Pixel 6a. But if you're fine with buying an older phone, there's still a lot to like here.\n\nThere's slick Google Assistant integration, a clean Android interface with three years of guaranteed updates, and a seriously impressive photography experience considering the Pixel 4a has just one rear camera.\n\nHowever, pull out the spec sheet and compare it to similarly priced rivals and the Google Pixel 4a doesn't seem like such a great deal, with less power, less RAM, fewer cameras, a smaller screen and no 5G connectivity - although the Pixel 4a 5G variant is coming in mere weeks with even better specs albeit at a higher price, alongside the Google Pixel 5 (which will also be 5G enabled).\n\nBattery life is mediocre, with the phone just about lasting a day on a single charge \u2013 and if you really push it you'll be reaching for a charger come late afternoon.\n\nThe design will be divisive. On the one hand it's a cutesy, curvy polycarbonate handset that sits comfortably in the palm, and its lightweight frame makes it easy to hold and use. There's a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, there's almost no screen bezel, and there's even a headphone jack.\n\nOn the other hand, it feels a little cheap, and it lacks the premium gloss of other handsets in its price bracket.\n\nIf you're thinking about getting the Google Pixel 4a you'll need to carefully consider what's important to you when it comes to a new smartphone. If you're looking for maximum bang for your buck, and features galore, the Pixel 4a is unlikely to whet your appetite.\n\nThat said, its compact size, clean interface and great point-and-shoot camera will appeal to those looking for an affordable, reasonably sized handset with enough grunt for social media, web browsing and emails, plus the ability to capture some excellent pictures.\n\nCheck out our special Google Pixel 4a unboxing video below\n\nGoogle Pixel 4a release date: Aug 20 (US), Sep 10 (AU), Oct 1 (UK)\n\nAug 20 (US), Sep 10 (AU), Oct 1 (UK) Google Pixel 4a price: $349 \/ \u00a3349 \/ AU$599\n\n$349 \/ \u00a3349 \/ AU$599 Just one configuration, one color and no larger Pixel 4a XL\n\nThe Google Pixel 4a price is $349 \/ \u00a3349 \/ AU$599. There are no configuration options, there's no, larger Pixel 4a XL, and there's only one color: Just Black. If you want the Pixel 4a, you'll have to sacrifice choice for that low price tag.\n\nThat's a competitive price point, and one that's $50 \/ \u00a350 \/ AU$50 cheaper than the launch price of its predecessor, the Google Pixel 3a. You also get more RAM (6GB vs 4GB) and more storage (128GB vs 64GB) with the Pixel 4a, so Google is giving you a decent amount of bang-for-your-buck, at least within its own ecosystem. Compared to the Google Pixel 4a 5G, which has better specs but costs more at $499 \/ \u00a3499 (around AU$695), the standard Pixel 4a remains a bargain.\n\nGoogle Pixel 4a specs Weight: 143g\n\nDimensions: 144 x 69.4 x 8.2 mm\n\nDisplay size: 5.81-inch\n\nResolution: FullHD+ (1080 x 2340)\n\nPixel density: 443ppi\n\nChipset: Snapdragon 730G\n\nRAM: 6GB\n\nStorage: 128GB\n\nRear camera: 12.2MP\n\nFront camera: 8MP\n\nBattery: 3,140mAh\n\nIt's also comfortably cheaper than its flagship namesakes, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL.\n\nTrouble is, the Google Pixel 4a is playing in a highly-competitive middle market, and is up against some handsets with far more impressive spec sheets \u2013 the likes of the OnePlus Nord, Realme X50 5G, Moto G 5G Plus and Mi Note 10 Lite can dazzle consumers with their multiple cameras, larger screens and 5G connectivity.\n\nWhile the handset itself won't differ between regions, when you could actually buy it did. The Google Pixel 4a landed in the US on August 20, 2020, with it following on September 10 in Australia and October 1 in the UK.\n\nExplaining the reason for the staggered release date, a Google spokesperson told TechRadar that \"our supply chain was impacted by Covid-19 and we had to adjust our launch plans accordingly to ensure the safety of our employees, partners and customers.\"\n\nThese are the best Google Pixel 4a deals for you right now\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nDesign\n\nCute, minimalist design can easily be used one-handed\n\nHeadphone jack included, plus stereo speakers\n\nLacks a premium finish\n\nCute. That's the one-word answer to 'describe the Google Pixel 4a design'.\n\nIt's one of the more compact Android smartphones you can get hold of these days, measuring 144 x 69.4 x 8.2mm, which makes it smaller than the Pixel 3a while boasting a bigger screen.\n\nThe result is a handset which is extremely easy to handle, and one-handed use is almost effortless. Those with smaller hands could still find it a bit of a stretch to reach the top of the display, but it sits comfortably in the palm.\n\nIt's light too, tipping the scales at just 143g, which makes it lighter than the Pixel 3a and the iPhone SE (which is actually smaller than the Pixel 4a).\n\nThat's due to the Pixel 4a's polycarbonate unibody \u2013 and while it helps the handset shed some weight, this does also mean that it doesn't look or feel particularly premium.\n\nYou may not see that as an issue, especially considering the affordable price, but for the same price you can get hold of metal- and glass-covered handsets that look and feel much more premium. The plus side here is that there's less glass to potentially smash, and the polycarbonate finish feels solid and hard-wearing.\n\nImage 1 of 10 (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar) (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nYou'll find the mint-green accented power\/lock key situated conveniently under thumb or finger on the right of the handset, with a black volume rocker just below, while the SIM tray is on the opposite side \u2013 this can only hold a single SIM, but the Google Pixel 4a also comes with a built-in eSIM card.\n\nAn eSIM (embedded SIM) is a digital version of the SIM card that you use to connect your phone to a network provider. The chip can be reprogrammed to suit whatever carrier you want to use; however not all carriers support eSIM, so you'll need to check with your provider whether you'll be able to use this function in the Pixel 4a.\n\nIt's also worth noting that eSIM functionality is only enabled for a select number of countries: the US, UK, Australia, Canada, Spain, Germany, Taiwan and Japan.\n\nOn the bottom of the Pixel 4a you'll find a USB-C 3.1 port in the center, flanked by microphone and speaker grilles. The down-firing speaker works with a second speaker just above the display to provide you with stereo sound.\n\nA feature the Google Pixel 4a has carried over from its predecessor \u2013 and something the flagship 4 series doesn't have \u2013 is a 3.5mm headphone jack. It's located on the top edge of the handset, allowing you to plug in your wired headphones.\n\nYou don't get a pair of earbuds in the box (unless you're in France or Australia, where you do), but if you have a set of favored cans you can use them with the Pixel 4a without having to dig out an adapter \u2013 and with no adapter occupying the USB-C port you can charge the handset at the same time as using wired headphones.\n\nAnother feature borrowed from the Pixel 3a is the rear fingerprint scanner. Google dropped fingerprint scanning for the Pixel 4 and 4 XL in favor of facial recognition, but we're pleased to see the digit-based sensor return on the Pixel 4a.\n\nIt falls comfortably under the forefinger, and recognition is fast \u2013 we didn't experience any errors during our review period.\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nThe only minor niggle with rear-mounted fingerprint sensors is they can't be used when the phone is placed on a desk or side table, which means you'll have to either tap in your passcode or pattern, or pick the Pixel 4a up to reach the sensor. There's also no face unlock support.\n\nOverall, the Pixel 4a has a minimalist design, with the centrally located fingerprint scanner and square camera block in the top-left corner the only points of note on the rear.\n\nConsidering the phone has just one rear-facing camera, the size of the camera block seems a little excessive, but it's presumably a design decision from Google as it looks to mimic the square bump on the rear of the Pixel 4 and 4 XL.\n\nOn the plus side, the bump isn't raised all that much from the rear of the phone, which means you can place it on a surface and tap away at the screen with minimal wobble.\n\nWhile the compact form factor of the Pixel 4a will appeal to many, in 2019 we also got the larger Pixel 3a XL, which offered much of the same specs as its smaller sibling, but with a larger 6-inch display (vs 5.6-inch) and larger battery.\n\nSo why is there no Google Pixel 4a XL? A Google spokesperson told TechRadar that \"without bezels on the display, we're now able to fit more display in a compact form factor. We think 5.8-inch is the perfect size for our Pixel 4a customer.\n\n\"The screen size increased 4.5% while the overall device size decreased 5.8% [versus the Pixel 3a], with a more polished industrial design.\"\n\nWhether 5.8 inches is enough real estate for your smartphone pursuits will be a decision you'll have to make, but if you\u2019re looking to play intensive games, or look at complex applications, you may want to consider a device with a larger screen.\n\nDisplay\n\n5.81-inch OLED display with Full HD+ resolution and HDR support\n\nFirst all-screen, bezel-less Pixel phone\n\nIt's bright, clear and responsive\n\nTalking of the Google Pixel 4a display, let's take a closer look at it. As we've already established, it's larger (by 0.2 inches) than the Pixel 3a's screen, but Google has taken things a step further with the Pixel 4a, and done away with the bezels almost entirely.\n\nThis is the first Pixel smartphone to come with an all-screen, bezel-less display, with the screen flowing around the punch-hole that houses the front-facing camera in the top-left.\n\nWhile Google says it has removed the bezels on the Pixel 4a, if you look closely there's still a sliver at the base of the display and the edging around the rest of the display is thicker than we've seen on some rivals.\n\nStill, it provides for an aesthetically pleasing finish, and while the selfie camera does sit in the notification bar, it doesn\u2019t really reduce the number of icons that can be displayed, which is nice.\n\nGoogle even includes some custom wallpapers which take into account the camera appearing within the display itself \u2013 just long-press on the home screen and tap \"style & wallpapers\" to check them out in the \u2018For Fun\u2019 folder.\n\nWe've seen similar wallpapers on other handsets, such as the Galaxy S10 series, and we'd expect to see a bunch of fan-made options to hit the web in the coming months.\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nThe screen is protected by Gorilla Glass 3, which should protect it against small scruffs and scratches, but it\u2019s not the most advanced version of the toughened glass from Corning \u2013 the OnePlus Nord, for example, uses the fifth-generation glass on both its front and rear, while the Sony Xperia 1 II features the latest, sixth-generation glass.\n\nUsing the older glass is a clear cost-saving measure by Google, but as long as you're reasonably careful with the phone it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nThe 5.81-inch screen is an OLED panel with a Full HD+, 1080 x 2340 resolution equating to a pixel density of 443ppi, and a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.\n\nThe screen provides bright, clear and colorful visuals, and thanks to the handset's diminutive size it's each to reach pretty much all corners of the display.\n\nWatching the HDR-enabled Space Force on Netflix was a pleasing experience, with excellent detail and color reproduction; however \u2013 and yes, we are going to say it \u2013 having moved from the OnePlus Nord to the Google Pixel 4a, the screen did feel a little small.\n\nThe Google Pixel 4a also features an always-on display, which will permanently display the time, date, battery level, weather and other information depending on the situation; for example, if you have alarms set it'll show your next alarm, and if you're listening to music on the Pixel 4a it'll show you the track name and artist.\n\nIt will also display notification icons, alerting you to new messages and information, and allowing you to decide whether or not you need to reach for your phone.\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nCamera\n\nJust two cameras: 12.2MP on rear, 8MP on front\n\nImpressive image processing produces high-quality snaps\n\nNight Sight produces decent low-light shots\n\nThe Google Pixel 4a is in the minority when it comes to cameras, having just two: one on the back and one on the front.\n\nThere aren't too many other phones with so few cameras, especially in the crowded mid-tier, where manufacturers tend to scatter cameras around like confetti in order to try and make their handsets stand out, although the new iPhone SE is another.\n\nOn the back you get a 12.2MP camera with a f\/1.7 aperture and an 84-degree field of view. It can shoot 4K video at 30fps, 1080p at 30fps, 60fps and 120fps, and 720p at 30fps, 60fps and a super-slow 240fps.\n\nWhile it may not look like much on paper, especially when compared to the three- and four-camera setups on the back of many of the Google Pixel 4a's rivals, this main camera can still hold its own.\n\nThe Pixel 4a makes photography easy \u2013 just point and shoot, and most of the time the camera, combined with Google's intelligent software processing, means you'll get a great photo in many scenarios.\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nThere are a handful of modes to choose from if you want something slightly different, including panorama and portrait, the latter of which produces a background blur effect using purely AI, as there's no depth sensor on the Pixel 4a.\n\nThe results from both are good, and portrait mode is especially impressive given the relatively simple hardware on offer.\n\nIf you look carefully, you can see some of the stitching in panoramas, especially if you don't have the steadiest hand when shooting, and the background blur sometimes isn't as precise around your subject, depending on how complex the shape is.\n\nThat said, for a handset with such an affordable price tag, the photography prowess is still impressive.\n\nForgot to switch to portrait mode? You can apply a bokeh effect to photographs you've already taken \u2013 even ones from years ago taken with a different device \u2013 by heading to the Photos app, tapping edit and then using the blur slider to create the effect.\n\nWe tried it with a couple of snaps we'd taken while reviewing the OnePlus Nord a couple of weeks previously, and the Pixel 4a was able to apply the background blur to the images without too much trouble.\n\nIf you're shooting a scene which has overly dark or bright areas, you can tap on a problematic area of the image to bring up the dual exposure controls and adjust the brightness of just that part of the frame, as part of the Pixel 4a's Live HDR+ plus feature. This gives you a live preview, for a better idea of how the final shot will look.\n\nThe dual exposure controls in the Pixel 4a camera app (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nIt allows you to take more balanced shots, and is especially useful if your subject is backlit \u2013 a situation where they can easily be cast into shadow.\n\nYou'll also be prompted to switch modes if the phone detects low light levels, with the camera app suggesting that you try Night Sight instead of the standard camera option.\n\nNight Sight is one of the best night modes we've used on a smartphone, and while the hardware and processing power on the Pixel 4a aren't up to the levels of the phone's flagship siblings, it still does an impressive job after the sun sets.\n\nThere's a dramatic difference between the standard camera mode and Night Sight, with photos significantly brightened, but usually in a way which doesn't look too artificial. You'll need to hold the Pixel 4a still for a few seconds as Night Sight captures the scene at different exposure levels though \u2013 we'd recommend resting it against something, or using a tripod, for the best possible results.\n\nIt works much better outdoors, and as long as there's some sort of light source (it really doesn't need to be much) you can get clear shots, although the detail can be a little muddy. Night Sight can also be used indoors, but images tend to look grainier.\n\nNight Sight takes views like this and transforms them (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nNight Sight has an additional mode built into it: astrophotography, which debuted on the Pixel 4, and there are several criteria you'll need to meet in order for this to work.\n\nFirst you'll need to be outside at night, and it needs to be dark \u2013 and we mean really dark. In our residential area, it wasn't dark enough due to light pollution (even at 11pm) for the astrophotography mode to be triggered.\n\nSecond, you'll need to find somewhere to rest the Pixel 4a as it points at the stars, and if you're planning on using the Night Sight, and particularly astrophotography, modes frequently we'd recommend investing in a small tripod \u2013 you won't be able to use the astrophotography mode hand-held, as the phone needs to be stable, with zero hand shake.\n\nAnd third, you'll need some patience. Once you've found your suitably dark location, and have the Pixel 4a set up rock-steady and pointing at the sky, after a few seconds the screen will read 'astrophotography on'. Hit the shutter button, and the handset will proceed to capture your shot \u2013 this can take between one and five minutes, so don't move the phone too early.\n\nWe were unable to find a suitably dark location during our initial review time with the Pixel 4a, but we're planning a rural escape in the coming days, and we'll update this review with our astro-mode results.\n\nWith just a single rear camera, the Pixel 4a doesn't offer an optical or hybrid zoom, relying solely on its imaging smarts to give you up to a 7x digital zoom \u2013 although while it may be purely digital, at 2x you'd be hard pushed to tell, unless you examined the snaps in detail.\n\nThe degradation in quality is a little more noticeable at 7x, but if you have a steady hand and there's good, natural outdoor light the Pixel 4a is capable of taking some pleasing zoomed-in shots.\n\nHaving just the single camera also means there's no wide-angle option, and nor is there a dedicated macro camera. There's not much you can do to get around the lack of a wide-angle camera, other than take a few more steps back if your surroundings allow, or perhaps switch to panorama mode.\n\nWhile the latter allows you to capture sweeping vistas, or a socially distanced group of friends, it's not as convenient as a dedicated wide-angle camera. For many users, this won't be an issue, but if you're looking for maximum photography flexibility there are other handsets in the Pixel 4a's price range that can offer this.\n\nSimilarly, the lack of a macro camera is unlikely to be an issue for many users, and the Pixel 4a camera does an okay job of close-up photography, allowing you to get reasonably near to subjects and capture a good level of detail.\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nThere's also just a single camera on the front of the Google Pixel 4a \u2013 it's an 8MP, f\/2.0 snapper with an 84-degree field of view, and it can shoot 1080p video at 30fps.\n\nThere's the obligatory portrait mode, which can apply background blur for arty self-portraits, and Night Sight is also available on the front camera \u2013 we found this worked well when we were trying to snap a selfie in lighting that was less than ideal, as long as it wasn't really dark.\n\nOverall, the front-facing camera on the Google Pixel 4a is a solid snapper, and produces selfies with good color and detail.\n\nThese are the best cameras for beginners you can buy right now\n\nCamera samples\n\nImage 1 of 19 The Pixel 4a's single camera can take detailed shots (Image credit: TechRadar) The 7x digital may don't be the best, but we can still see the ducks.

In short, the Pixel 4a is a smartphone you'll need to be charging each night.\n\nYou won't get more than a day from the Pixel 4a battery (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nAnd the battery does take a bit of a beating when it comes to gaming or video playback. Three hours of gaming plus three hours of music streaming over Spotify via Bluetooth headphones helped deplete the Pixel 4a's battery to a level where we needed to reach for the charger by early evening.\n\nSomething we did find very useful was seeing the estimated time when the battery will run out in the notification bar. It's not shown permanently \u2013 you're shown the battery icon and a percentage-remaining next to it \u2013 but pull down the notification shade and the percentage is replaced by the estimated time when the Pixel 4a will run out of juice.\n\nUseful: an estimated time of when your phone battery will die (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nIt's a far more useful metric, and gives you a better idea of whether you'll need to plug the handset in for a quick charge, or whether that remaining 20% will see you through the rest of the day.\n\nThere's no wireless charging support here \u2013 not a huge surprise given the mid-range price \u2013 but you do get an 18W charging block included in the box with the Pixel 4a, providing the handset with fast charging capabilities.\n\nIn our tests, a 15 minute fast charge saw the Google Pixel 4a recoup around 20% of battery, while 30 minutes of top-up saw around 35% returned to the tank. It's reasonable, but not as fast as we've seen from other handsets.\n\nPerformance and software\n\nSnapdragon 730, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage\n\nStock Android 10 is clean and easy to use\n\nGoogle Assistant features prominently\n\nThe Google Pixel 4a comes with enough power to ensure you can do everything you want on the phone. You get a Snapdragon 730 chipset, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (of which around 108GB is actually available to you).\n\nThese specs are more than acceptable at the Pixel 4a's price, but an issue arises if you start to look around, because in terms of the spec sheet the Google Pixel 4a is out-gunned by rivals in a number of ways.\n\nThere are plenty of similarly priced handsets offering newer chipsets, more RAM, and a variety of storage options \u2013 not to mention a whole array of cameras. Google isn't being drawn into the specs arms race, and that may make it harder for the Pixel 4a to stand out.\n\nIt can handle any app or game that you run, but you may find that some take a second or two longer to load than you'd like, especially big online games or intensive applications.\n\nThe headphone jack is handy for gaming or watching video (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nPUBG, for example, runs at HD graphics and with the frame rate set to high, but load screens and the menu system do take a noticeable amount of time to load.\n\nOnce you're in-game PUBG runs smoothly enough, and we were able to claim some chicken dinners, although the graphics aren't running at their highest levels.\n\nThe Pixel 4a comes with Google's stock Android 10 operating system, which runs well and is easy to navigate. You can opt for gesture controls over the traditional navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen, and after a bit of practice the former make one-handed use even easier.\n\nGoogle guarantees you a minimum of three years of operating system and security updates for the Pixel 4a, which means the handset is set to get the major Android 11, Android 12 and Android 13 updates.\n\nAs on all Pixel devices there's a big focus on Google Assistant on the Pixel 4a, with multiple ways to summon the voice assistant. If you have gesture controls enabled you can swipe in from either corner at the bottom of the screen to trigger Assistant, or you can use the wake words 'Hey Google' or 'Okay Google'.\n\nStock Android is clean, and runs smoothly on the Pixel 4a (Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nOnce it's active, you can get Assistant to do numerous things, from opening apps and setting alarms to sending messages, searching for restaurants, or providing the definition of a word. The slick integration with the Pixel 4a allows for a more hands-free experience, and can reduce the amount of swipes and taps required to perform certain tasks.\n\nGoogle's voice recognition software is very good, and the Pixel 4a didn't have too much trouble understanding what we were saying; you do need to talk relatively clearly though, as mumbled words can sometimes be misunderstood.\n\nThe Pixel 4a also inherits the search giant's Recorder app, which can live-transcribe meetings and conversations. You can ask the assistant to start and stop recordings, and transcriptions can be imported to Google Docs for easy editing.\n\nAll transcription happens on-device, and there's no need for an internet connection, which means you can use Recorder anywhere, safe in the knowledge that recordings aren't being stored off-device.\n\nThe transcription accuracy is good, but it's certainly not perfect \u2013 if you speak quickly, without clear pronunciation, it can easily get a little confused, for example between 'three' and 'free'. However, it gets the majority of what\u2019s being said right, and it makes the writing-up process a lot easier.\n\nShould I buy the Google Pixel 4a?\n\n(Image credit: TechRadar)\n\nBuy it if\u2026\n\nYou want a phone you can use one-handed\n\nThere aren't too many smartphones around these days which you can comfortably use one-handed, but the Google Pixel 4a is one of them. Its compact (by 2020 standards) form factor, rounded edges and soft-touch polycarbonate body make it easy to hold and use.\n\nYou're invested in the Google ecosystem and want an affordable device\n\nIf you're fully invested in Google's ecosystem, embracing Google Assistant and using the firm's smart speakers in your home \u2013 and perhaps you even have Android Auto in your car \u2013 the Pixel 4a will fit into your setup pretty seamlessly. For those familiar with 'Okay Google' commands, the Pixel 4a is just an extension of what you already know.\n\nYou want an affordable phone that takes great, fuss-free photos\n\nThe two cameras on the Google Pixel 4a may not offer the greatest flexibility at this price point, but they do offer an easy point-and-shoot experience which, more often than not, means you can take quality photos with very little effort.\n\nDon't buy it if...\n\nYou're looking for the best bang for your buck\n\nThe Google Pixel 4a finds itself in a competitive field, and on paper it can't compete with the spec sheets of many of its competitors. Rival handsets boast 5G connectivity, multiple cameras, bigger screens, more power, larger storage options and premium designs \u2013 things the Pixel 4a simply doesn't have.\n\nYou want to do a lot of gaming on your phone\n\nWhile the Google Pixel 4a is perfectly capable of running games, it comes with a few compromises. The smaller screen (although it's still 5.8 inches) means there's less real estate for your eyes to lock onto \u2013 and your thumbs will cover some of it \u2013 while battery life takes a bit of a beating, and the phone doesn\u2019t have the same power as its competitors, meaning slightly longer load times.\n\nYou want a long-lasting battery\n\nThe Google Pixel 4a gets through a day on a single charge \u2013 just. If you have a penchant for gaming, or you're a heavy camera and social media user, you'll be reaching for the charger come mid-afternoon\/early evening. In short, if you get the Pixel 4a, you'll need to charge it every night, minimum.\n\nAlso consider\n\nNow that you've read our Google Pixel 4a review, check out some other similar phones that you might want to consider.\n\nImage 1 of 3 (Image credit: TechRadar) OnePlus Nord The OnePlus Nord has a bigger screen, more RAM, more storage, more power, six cameras and a premium design - which on paper makes it look like a sure-fire winner considering it's only a touch more expensive than the Google Pixel 4a - but the 4a does a lot with its more humble spec sheet. Read our in-depth OnePlus Nord review (Image credit: Future) Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL If you're looking for the very best of Google, then you'll want to consider the Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL. These full-fat, flagship siblings to the mid-range Pixel 4a pack in more power, a larger screen (in the case of the XL) and boast even more impressive cameras - with two on the rear of each.\n\n\n\nRead our in-depth reviews: Pixel 4 | Pixel 4 XL (Image credit: Future) iPhone SE (2020) If you're in the market for a compact, mid-range handset that you can easily use one-handed, there's another big name offering for you to choose from - the new iPhone SE.

This data was uncovered by Pex, in their analysis of 2019 on the video-sharing platform.\n\nWhile YouTube is still the de facto content platform for widespread visibility, clearing the hurdle from obscurity to fame is no easy feat. The overwhelming majority of YouTube videos (88.4%) still generate fewer than 1,000 views.\n\nAdding to this shocking statistic is another quite puzzling one. A microcosm of YouTube channels are actually reaching 100,000 views per video on average. Only 0.77% of all content on YouTube is reaching such a milestone, but they account for 82.83% of the actual total viewer figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat might not be a shock to some people, but it actually showcases some of the problems with the systems that are suggesting content to viewers, especially when over 80% of views on the YouTube platform are coming from such a small pool of content and creators.\n\nDespite the explosive growth in Gaming uploads, it\u2019s not the best performing category on YouTube. Music continues to dominate the platform with more views per video than any other category. When normalizing for the duration of each upload, Music\u2019s lead is even more pronounced. Music\u2019s 2,944 views per minute is more than double that of Entertainment and roughly 22 times greater than Gaming.\n\nMusic is unsurprisingly the most dominant video category on YouTube. Music videos were the most viewed category in 2019. Gaming is the most uploaded category but fares poorly when compared to other common videos on YouTube. This is likely due to the space being especially crowded.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf this report has highlighted one thing, it\u2019s just how difficult it is for creators to make a breakthrough on the service. As the platform is constantly lambasted by fans and creators alike, some reforms may need to be made to help make YouTube a more even playing field for all.\n\nOn top of that, if you were thinking of starting a YouTube channel in 2020, don\u2019t go in expecting views to explode overnight.\n\nMore on YouTube:"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/technology\/news\/story\/google-brings-in-link-previews-and-smart-compose-feature-for-android-and-iphone-users-1708297-2020-08-06","domain":"indiatoday.in","published_date":"2020-08-06 05:45:48","title":"Google brings in Link Previews and Smart Compose feature for Android and iPhone users","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com\/sites\/indiatoday\/resources\/img\/default-690x413.png","content":"Google will update Docs with new features like the Link Previews and Smart Compose feature for mobile users.

These bunkers were first discovered around the Call of Duty: Warzone map shortly after the free-to-play battle royale game was released back in March 2020. That said, players couldn't open them until the 1.21 update for the game in May 2020, and more bunkers (and similar secret locations) have been added to the game since.\n\nThese bunkers played a part in teasing the new full-priced Call of Duty game in 2020, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Following Modern Warfare Season 5 at the start of August, the red access cards needed to unlock the bunkers have returned with some noticeable upgrades and blue access cards appeared as well. Meanwhile, more secret bunkers that were tougher to find were also added around Verdansk.\n\nIf you want to access these bunkers and see what all the fuss is about, here's what you need to know about unlocking these bunkers in Activision's widely successful battle royale.\n\nWhere are the bunker locations in Call of Duty: Warzone?\n\nIt's unlikely that you'll be able to make it to every bunker location during a single match, as they are all spread out across Verdansk. As such, it's smart to target just one or two during a battle royale match. Thankfully, most of them are near major locations so you can find them with just a bit of effort scouring the environment.\n\nTo access 11 of the game's bunkers, you'll need a Red Access Card gathered from chests to open the doors. While these items used to only come from the rare legendary crates around Verdansk, they're now in any colored crate, including common crates.\n\nSeason 5 also introduced a new red card icon with the shape of a key on it that appears next to the name and health of any active player. YouTuber MrDalekJD claims that the new red key cards will open bunkers 0, 4, 5, 6, and 9. Other bunkers are seemingly inaccessible, but things appear to be constantly in flux.\n\nHere are all 11 bunker locations on the 'Call of Duty: Warzone' map. Activision\n\nBunker 1: On the northern end of the Junkyard region\n\nOn the northern end of the Junkyard region Bunker 2: Another on the northern end of just east of the Junkyard region just west of Boneyard\n\nAnother on the northern end of just east of the Junkyard region just west of Boneyard Bunker 3: Between the military base and dam in Bloc 23\n\nBetween the military base and dam in Bloc 23 Bunker 4: On the southern end of the Junkyard region just west of Boneyard\n\nOn the southern end of the Junkyard region just west of Boneyard Bunker 5: Just south of the military base in the Lazoff Pass region\n\nJust south of the military base in the Lazoff Pass region Bunker 6: East of the quarry in Bloc 18\n\nEast of the quarry in Bloc 18 Bunker 7: Northeast of the Verdansk stadium\n\nNortheast of the Verdansk stadium Bunker 8: Also Northeast of the Verdansk stadium in Bloc 18\n\nAlso Northeast of the Verdansk stadium in Bloc 18 Bunker 9: Northeast of the prison in the southeast corner of the map\n\nNortheast of the prison in the southeast corner of the map Bunker 10: South of the park near the edge of the map\n\nLearn why Call of Duty: Warzone is the perfect game to play during the Covid-19 quarantine.\n\nWhat rewards do you get for visiting a Call of Duty: Warzone bunker?\n\nThese 10 bunkers are worth visiting as they contain excellent loot thanks to Legendary Supply Boxes, weapon blueprints, and money scattered around each of them. Still, they do have locked doors, suggesting that there is more to these bunkers than currently meets the eye. As Activision begins to tease Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War more and more, expect these bunkers to only become more interesting and useful.\n\nWhere are the secret bunkers in Call of Duty: Warzone?\n\nThe Bloc 23 Bunker: While there are 10 regular bunkers for players to find, there are several other more secretive ones that have appeared on Verdansk over time. There is an eleventh secret bunker in Call of Duty: Warzone. It can be found northwest of the military base in Bloc 23 near the edge of the map.\n\nTo access this bunker, you'll have to gather intel from a series of message phones scattered across the map and decipher a code. You'll get a three-digit number encoded in Russian. Using that number, you must then visit different Morse code phones in the correct order. (GamesRadar has a handy guide for that.)\n\nWhile the three-digit code given is randomized, the specific phone locations they reference are not. After picking up the phones for all three, the eleventh bunker will be unlocked. (It's the northern-most red dot on our above map.)\n\nInside the bunker, you'll receive a blueprint for a legendary MP7, so it's definitely worth going out of your way to find. That said, it may be best to do this in Plunder as the shrinking arena of the battle royale mode will make it hard to get to this final bunker most of the time.\n\nThe Secret Station: Next, there is a secret train station that players could find starting in Season 6. That said, it requires players to solve a difficult puzzle at City Hall. Small images that are parts of paintings of City Hall are shown to players, as is a command to add or subtract a certain number. Players then must add, subtract, or do nothing based on the images shown in order to get the code.\n\nThe latest season of Call of Duty: Warzone brought a new bunker with it.\n\nThen, players have to put in the top and bottom half of each number that's part of the code. All of this is done on an extremely short timer, and requires a team that communicates well. If you're able to do it successfully, you can interact with a terminal at the airport's metro station and take the train to the secret station. For more details, check out Inverse's dedicated guide on this subject.\n\nThe airport bunker: Yet another bunker was added as part of the latest season. As a video by Valkia explains, this new secret bunker is located in a hole in the ground that has popped up at Verdansk's airport. This bunker doesn't require any special codes to access, you'll just need to hit it up right at the start of a match if you want to get all of its best loot.\n\nCall of Duty: Warzone is available now for PC, PS4, and Xbox One."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.phonearena.com\/news\/huawei-mate-x2-5g-design-specs-leak_id126501","domain":"phonearena.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 18:23:00","title":"Big Huawei Mate X2 5G leak reveals key design details and specs","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/m-cdn.phonearena.com\/images\/article\/126501-wide-two_1200\/Big-Huawei-Mate-X2-5G-leak-reveals-key-design-details-and-specs.jpg?1597083824","content":"The Huawei Mate Xs\n\n\n\n\n\nFoldable smartphones are still very much in their infancy, but newly leaked information suggests Huawei is ready to concede that Samsung introduced a superior foldable design last year with the Galaxy Fold.\n\nThe Huawei Mate X2 will look a lot like the Fold 2\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young has heard from seemingly reliable sources within the display industry that Huawei has plans to fit the foldable Mate X2 with an in-folding display rather than an outward-folding panel.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat decision essentially means Huawei is looking to ditch the unique Mate X and Mate Xs design in favor of something that closely resembles the foldable Samsung Galaxy Fold & Z Fold 2.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smartphone will feature an 8.03-inch display like the original models, according to Ross Young, with the key difference being the way it folds. That will be coupled with a 4.5-inch external screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei hopes to source its panels from long-term partner BOE and rival Samsung, which means the Mate X2 will be the first non-Samsung foldable to feature a Samsung display. But unlike the Galaxy Z Flip and Fold 2, Huawei will be using plastic rather than ultra-thin glass.\n\nHuawei could use a Kirin chipset inside the Mate X2\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei recently announced that it will stop production of Kirin chipsets on Tuesday, September 15, due to the restrictions imposed by the US Government on the company. The Mate 40 series was also confirmed to be the final Kirin-powered flagship from Huawei.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite this, Ross Young believes the ultra-premium Mate X2 will arrive equipped with the next-gen Kirin 1000 chipset coupled with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage as standard. Expandable storage support is unlikely, but 12\/256GB and 16\/512GB variants are planned.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso planned, according to Young, is 5G network support and a massive 6,000mAh battery that supports ridiculously fast 65W charging technology. The software version isn't specified, but Android 11 and EMUI 11 straight out of the box are extremely likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat will enable a so-called Laptop Mode that, as the name suggests, works at a 120-degree angle like a traditional laptop.

A 5-megapixel depth sensor is expected too.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs for the selfie cameras, rumor has it that Huawei will fit the Mate X2 with either a 16-megapixel camera or a 32-megapixel alternative.\n\nHuawei Mate X2 announcement and release date\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious Huawei foldables have been introduced at MWC in February in Barcelona, so perhaps the Huawei Mate X2 will follow a similar announcement timeline by making an appearance at the 2021 edition.\n\n\n\nThe actual release, however, could happen quite a few months later. The original Mate X foldable was only made available to purchase in China and the newer Mate Xs is only available in a limited number of markets at certain locations and retailers.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei should make the Mate X2 more easily available, but considering its lack of Google apps and services, it could be quite hard to find in Europe and other international markets.\n\n\n\n"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.eurogamer.net\/articles\/2020-08-05-as-call-of-duty-warzone-popularity-explodes-activision-prepares-to-reveal-black-ops-cold-war-within-its-battle-royale","domain":"eurogamer.net","published_date":"2020-08-05 09:32:00","title":"As Call of Duty: Warzone popularity explodes, Activision prepares to reveal Black Ops Cold War within its battle royale","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/assetsio.gnwcdn.com\/as-call-of-duty-warzone-popularity-explodes-activision-prepares-to-reveal-black-ops-cold-war-within-its-battle-royale-1596620325773.jpg?width=690&quality=75&format=jpg&auto=webp","content":"Activision has announced Call of Duty: Warzone now has over 75 million players - and signalled its intent to reveal this year's title in its battle royale.\n\nOvernight, to coincide with its financial results, Activision confirmed both Treyarch and Raven Software are co-developing the next premium Call of Duty game, which Eurogamer has reported to be called Black Ops Cold War.\n\nIt\u2019s official. Looking forward to showing you what we\u2019ve been cooking up with @RavenSoftware! \u2014 Treyarch Studios (@Treyarch) August 4, 2020 To see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\n\nThis much about the game - and its troubled development - was known. And while Activision has already teased Black Ops within Warzone with the odd Easter egg, executives last night gave the clearest indication yet that a big reveal of Black Ops Cold War is around the corner.\n\nUsing Warzone as a platform to reveal Black Ops Cold War marks a significant departure for Activision in a number of significant ways. For one, the Modern Warfare and Black Ops brands are crossing over, which they traditionally do not do - with the standalone, free-to-download battle royale set to continue as a playground for the various Call of Duty franchises even as new premium titles are released.\n\nAnd Activision has never announced a Call of Duty game in this way - or this late in the year - before. Traditionally, it announces the next Call of Duty in May, with reveals spread out over the upcoming months before launch in time for Christmas.\n\nThe success of Warzone sparked a change in Activision's marketing strategy, Activision Publishing boss Rob Kostich said last night in response to a question from Cowen and Company analyst Doug Creutz, who asked why it's taken so long for the next Call of Duty to be announced.\n\n\"The success of Warzone and Call of Duty Mobile in addition to, of course what we continue to see on our premium games has created a ton of new opportunities for the franchise,\" Kostich replied.\n\n\"And so, starting with marketing, it's definitely had an impact there and how we think about marketing in this new world. As you've seen from our results, right now, we have a larger, more-engaged and more global audience than we've ever had at any point in time in our history. And that means that we could be more direct and more targeted than we've ever been before. So, that's a huge benefit and plus for us as we think about marketing on that vector.\n\n\"Another thing, I think, that's really important for us as it relates to marketing is from storytelling - from a storytelling perspective, where we can be even more creative and so on and engaging with our fans than ever before.\n\n\"So, if you look at Warzone in particular, it's not only like a great game experience, but it's also a great platform for us to share new franchise news and information directly with our community like we haven't done before. So, this is also a big and positive change for us as we think about the business.\n\n\"And kind of to your initial point that you're talking about why you were waiting for such a long time, we are where we are, but it's Warzone I think that's caused us to rethink how, when and even where we reveal our upcoming title.\n\n\"So, we can't wait to share it with the community and we think it's going to be very different and more engaging than anything that we've ever done before. Now, as you heard on the call before, Treyarch and Raven are coming up with the next premium game, and obviously very excited on what they're working on and we do think fans are going to absolutely love it. The game works incredible right now. And internally people having a ton of fun playing across, its campaign mode as well as the online modes, the developers are very well known for. And so, all I can say in terms of timing is that, I expect you'll be hearing more about this fairly soon.\"\n\nThe burning question, of course, is how will Black Ops Cold War and Warzone work together. Currently, Modern Warfare and Warzone share the same battle pass. Modern Warfare and Warzone even share the same loudouts, which causes its own set of balance problems. Assuming Black Ops Cold War introduces a battle pass, will Warzone then have two?\n\nKostich kept his cards close to his chest, but did promise \"a very tight integration between the two\".\n\n\"Modern Warfare and Warzone are obviously very tightly connected. Maybe that's really important for the player base. We plan to do the same with our upcoming titles as well, our premium titles, to ensure we can reward all of our players and give an impression and experiences, regardless of whether they choose to just play in Warzone or also playing the premium game as well. So, the connection will absolutely be there.\"\n\nCall of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone Season 5 kicked off this morning, and players are currently hunting for secrets and Easter eggs that relate to Black Ops Cold War. Dataminers are already digging into the game's files, as you'd expect. Surely it won't be long now before the next big Call of Duty is out in the open."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.soyacincau.com\/2020\/08\/04\/xiaomi-redmi-note-9-malaysia-price-cut-official\/","domain":"soyacincau.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 13:52:47","title":"Redmi Note 9 128GB now priced under RM700","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/soyacincau.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/200804-redmi-note-9-malaysia-750x375.jpg","content":"Apart from the Poco F2 Pro, Xiaomi has also announced a price reduction for its Redmi Note 9 series.

It seems to be growing more complicated by the minute.\n\nThroughout the centuries, humans have used storytelling to make sense of the world around them. That is perhaps more true today than it ever was, as we have access to more stories (via the internet) than we ever have in history. But with this proliferation, it\u2019s critical that the very best storytellers \u2014 a diverse group of storytellers \u2014 have access to the broadest audiences.\n\nImagine Impact, a content accelerator founded and led by Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, and Tyler Mitchell aims to provide storytellers with the tools and access they need to reach as many people as possible. That\u2019s why we\u2019re thrilled to have Grazer, Howard, and Mitchell join us at Disrupt 2020 on September 14-18.\n\nBrian Grazer is an Academy Award, Golden Globe, Emmy and Grammy Award-winning producer, racking up 43 Oscar nominations and 198 Emmy nominations, winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards for \u201cA Beautiful Mind.\u201d He\u2019s also a NYT bestselling author twice over and was named one of Time Magazine\u2019s \u201c100 Most Influential People in the World.\u201d He co-founded Imagine Entertainment alongside Ron Howard in the 80s, and has now gone on to co-found Imagine Impact alongside Howard and Mitchell.\n\nRon Howard needs no introduction. The Academy Award-winning filmmaker has been a creative force in some of Hollywood\u2019s most memorable films, including \u201cA Beautiful Mind,\u201d \u201cApollo 13\u201d and \u201cSplash.\u201d Alongside his illustrious film career, Howard has also executive-produced a variety of award-winning television shows, including the Emmy-winning series \u201cArrested Development\u201d and the HBO miniseries \u201cFrom the Earth to the Moon.\u201d\n\nTyler Mitchell is a producer, writer and entrepreneur who has previously held the role of executive vice president at Imagine Entertainment, where he oversaw a slate of live-action films as well as launching Imagine\u2019s animation division. He has also produced films in his own right, including \u201cThe Incredible Burt Wonderstone,\u201d \u201cLucky Number Slevin\u201d and \u201cMaudie.\u201d Producer and writer for prime-time shows \u201cKidnapped\u201d and \u201cMy Own Worst Enemy,\u201d Mitchell also has experience in the world of television.\n\nThese three launched Imagine Impact two years ago to bring to Hollywood Silicon Valley-style mentorship, a model cultivated by Y Combinator and various VCs in the tech world. As Netflix democratizes storytelling through its global platform for talent, Imagine Impact offers a place to vet that talent from the outset and nurture it through to the networks, studios and media platforms.\n\nNetflix and Imagine Impact struck a deal in June to identify and develop film ideas across four genres, through a global submission process, that they will bring to Netflix for production and distribution.\n\nImagine Impact vets submissions with both experienced readers and a natural language processing system that was developed internally at the accelerator.\n\nSince the first Impact program, the incubator has accepted 65 writers and paired them with industry experts (such as A Beautiful Mind\u2019s Akiva Goldsman. Thus far, 62 developed projects have come out of the process, with 22 being sold or set up with major studios, networks and\/or streaming services.\n\nWe\u2019re thrilled to have Grazer, Howard and Mitchell join us at Disrupt 2020 to talk about how they\u2019re mixing Silicon Valley tech and mentorship with the traditional Hollywood creative process and what the future of storytelling has in store for us.

Not only does he go over some of the cars he designed -- like the original BMW X5 , Fiat's reborn 500 or the Maserati MC12 -- he dissects the styling of a whole bunch of other cars, too. The latest video, which published earlier this week, takes a look at the new BMW 4 Series coupe, a car that's causing quite a bit of controversy, namely for its giant grille.\n\nIt's important to note why Stephenson's take on the 4 Series is extra-interesting. This is a man who spent many years designing cars for BMW, so he knows all about the company's internal workings. Even so, he admits it's \"difficult to understand\" why BMW would put a grille like this on one of its new cars, as it doesn't go with the proportions of the rest of the coupe. Stephenson says the grille almost looks like nostrils, and that's not a compliment. He also notes it's weird that the positioning of the front license plate doesn't seem to have been considered when designing this car. \"You can't forget about the registration plate,\" he says.\n\nGrille aside, Stephenson says the 4 Series has \"nice proportions,\" but finds a lot of other things to nitpick. For example, he regrets that BMW seems to have nearly eliminated the company's iconic Hofmeister kink and says there's \"a lot happening\" at the rear. Perhaps it's a good thing BMW will keep this design exclusive to the 4 Series.\n\nThe 14-minute-long video is a great watch, and Stephenson has a lot of really interesting things to say about the new 4 Series. It's worth your time, and be sure to sound off with what you think of the new 4 Series' design in the comments."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.essentiallysports.com\/apex-legends-shroud-loses-his-mind-over-new-crafting-feature-esports-news\/","domain":"essentiallysports.com","published_date":"2020-08-16 19:10:00","title":"Apex Legends: Shroud Loses His Mind Over Crafting Feature in Season 6","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Logo-Full-1.png","content":"The Apex Legends trailer that released recently for the 6th Season promises a lot of new content.

Afolayan\u2019s films are part of a growing number of African contributions to the global online platform Netflix. His latest creation, Citation, explores the important issue of sexual exploitation of young female Nigerian students by their professors. For this gritty, hard-hitting movie, Afolayan chose the new EOS C500 Mark II from Canon.\n\n\u201cI first saw the Canon EOS C500 Mark II at IBC 2019 and I was amazed at its capabilities. Normally it\u2019s not a director\u2019s place to tell a director of photography (DOP) what kit to use, but I always wanted to shoot in 4K full-frame, and I knew that this camera would make it to the Netflix approved list, which was vital for this production,\u201d said Nigerian actor, producer and director, Kunle Afolayan. \u201cThankfully Jonathan Kovel, the DOP working on my new film, loved the camera, therefore, we were able to shoot Citation with the Canon EOS C500 Mark II, which gave us another level of authenticity and creative freedom.\u201d\n\nIn Algeria, legendary director Merzak Allouache also selected the Canon EOS C500 Mark II for his latest film, as part of a technical partnership with Baya Productions. Following a glittering 40-year, 22 film career, which included 1994 Cannes Film Festival award-winning production, Le Repenti. 86-year-old Allouache marks his come back with a new cinematographic masterpiece UNE FAMILLE, that plunges the audience deep into an intensely real political and family drama.\n\n\u201cThe film benefited from the technology provided by Canon. The production team was provided with a Canon EOS C500 Mark II camera and a range of Cine Lenses and accessories so that the film could be shot entirely in 5.9K at 24 fps. The EOS 5D Mark IV and EOSR were also used throughout, to shoot the film and to photograph the behind-the-scenes footage,\u201d said Hamoudi Laggoune, the gifted Algerian cinematographer chosen to work alongside Allouache on the new film. \u201cThe camera provides complete flexibility and freedom to choose the image formats, bokeh effects and lenses that are best suited to the filming conditions,\u201d he added.\n\nSharing the Best Industry Knowledge\n\nThe Canon EOS cameras are more than just the choice for the established leaders in the film industry. Their agile imaging solution is well suited to a wide range of tasks and experience levels. Canon\u2019s cinema cameras, EOS DSLRs and lenses continue to be adopted by the movie industry for their high quality and dependable design. They are also the first choice with professional filmmakers, as evidenced by the 2020 Academy Award nominees and winners.\n\nTo help support all aspiring and established filmmakers during these challenging times, Canon will begin a three-month knowledge-sharing initiative with over 42 pro-video webinars called Canon Tech Talk Series for the film market in Africa. On August 11th, the first webinar will feature Canon\u2019s Amine Djouhara, alongside African film legends Hamoudi Laggoune and Kunle Afolayan. The opening session will explore the features of the Canon C500 Mark II, sharing their experience with the camera during their recent high-profile productions. Fans of these talented directors will get an exclusive behind the scenes perspective on their work and the equipment they trust.\n\nAfter this special first webinar, the CCNA team will continue with a series of Canon Tech Talk webinars on changing the face of filmmaking, covering vlogging, streaming, colour science, post-production, and a range of other film-making classes. The remaining 18 webinars divided between beginner and professional courses in three different languages (English, French and Arabic), ensuring everyone can continue to learn and grow during these strange times.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, we must come together to ensure that the global standstill does not set us back in our careers or our passion-projects,\u201d says Amine Djouhara, Sales and Marketing Director at Canon Central and North Africa. \u201cDuring these challenging times, this series of webinars offer a virtual developmental tool to maintain the evolution of critical skills for continued and sustainable growth of the film industry,\u201d\n\nTo register for the first Canon Tech Talk Series free webinars starting on August 12th, please click on the relevant links below:\n\n12th August \u2013 Kunle Afolayan Topic \u2013 Discover C500 Mark II Languages \u2013 English Time \u2013 1pm NG|3PM KEN\n\n\n\nIG : https:\/\/bit.ly\/3afYV0P\n\nFB : https:\/\/bit.ly\/2DOEvjt\n\nLinkedIN \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/2FdfZZW\n\nTwitter \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/2DTMeMS\n\n13th August \u2013 Raul Gabat Topic \u2013 Introduction to 4K Series Languages \u2013 English\n\n\n\nFB \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/3abE8eS\n\nIG \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/3alOnxi\n\nLinkedIN \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/3kznhYc\n\nTwitter \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/31HoqEi\n\n13th August \u2013 Andrew Emil Topic \u2013 Introduction to 4K Series Languages \u2013 Arabic\n\n\n\nFB \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/3gLTtW3\n\nIG \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/3ad0eNY\n\nLinkedIn \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/33OL9kK\n\nTwitter \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/2PIhZvm\n\n13th August \u2013 Jean Mazel Topic \u2013 Introduction to 4K Series Languages \u2013 French\n\n\n\nFB \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/3gNlGeO\n\nIG \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/3irxggf\n\nLinkedIN \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/3kxkuPc\n\nTwitter \u2013 https:\/\/bit.ly\/2XPnOvh\n\nRelated"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.ispreview.co.uk\/index.php\/2020\/08\/virgin-media-see-uk-network-traffic-surge-60-for-call-of-duty.html","domain":"ispreview.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-06 15:16:00","title":"Virgin Media and Openreach See UK Internet Traffic Surge for Call of Duty UPDATE","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.ispreview.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/nggallery_import\/call_of_duty_warzone-586x600.jpg","content":"Thursday, Aug 6th, 2020 (4:16 pm) - Score 5,351\n\nBroadband ISP Virgin Media has revealed that Wednesday\u2019s release of the new Call of Duty: Warzone Season 5 patch saw internet traffic over their network spike to 60% higher than the same time last week. During peak time (8pm to 10pm) there was also a 20% uplift in traffic. Openreach (BT) and TalkTalk were also hit.\n\nThe surge is hardly a surprise since the update weighed in at a hefty 34 GigaBytes on the PS4, while it was 50GB on the Xbox and 47GB on PC, which also made it one of the largest updates since Warzone mode was first released. Meanwhile another video game, Fortnite, also released a smaller 2GB update on the same day that could have contributed to the uplift in traffic.\n\nOverall, an additional 22 Petabytes of data was downloaded compared to Monday to Friday last week, with Northern Ireland and Wales seeing the largest uplift. At the peak of recorded traffic, the equivalent of more than 52 PS4 Warzone patches worth of data was being downloaded each second.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTraffic levels were kept in check as PS4 players had the ability to pre-download the update for the first time on Tuesday 4th August, which also saw a 10% uplift in peak time traffic compared to the last four Tuesdays,\u201d said a spokesperson for Virgin Media. The operator also noted that their average broadband speeds across all packages \u201cremained stable and above the headline speed\u201d during this period.\n\nSuffice to say that ISPs are comfortable with having to tackle such events and pressures on their networks. Many also employ Content Delivery Networks (CDN), which help to cache popular content closer to their end-users and this reduces the strain on external capacity links. You can also see the impact of Wednesday\u2019s traffic on switches at the London Internet Exchange (LINX).\n\nNOTE: LINX does NOT provide a complete overview of internet traffic flow from all of the ISPs, but they do offer a useful indication of how much extra traffic is flowing around.\n\nMeanwhile, on the same day, Openreach (BT) reported the \u201cthe highest level ever observed for broadband traffic\u201d on their network, with more than 193 PetaBytes of data being consumed. This compares to the previous busiest days of Thursday 9th July (192PB) and Thursday 30th June (189PB).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA spokesperson for Openreach told ISPreview.co.uk: \u201cWednesday saw the anticipated release of another hugely popular update of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, including Warzone Season 5, across a number of gaming platforms including PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC. We knew this was coming, and we\u2019ve built enough capacity in the network to cope with extraordinary peaks like this.\u201d\n\nNOTE: 1 PetaByte is equal to 1,000 TeraBytes (TB) or 1,000,000 GigaBytes (GB).\n\nThe PC release of another major title, Horizon: Zero Dawn, which started pre-loading today and is due out tomorrow may, also have an impact for the rest of this week.\n\nUPDATE 7th August 2020\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBudget ISP TalkTalk have informed us that they also saw a 56% surge in daytime network traffic vs last week following the release of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Season 5. At 9:45pm on Wednesday last night they recorded a network spike of 6.27Tb\/s (Terabits per second), although this isn\u2019t quite as high as the 6.71Tb\/s seen during the June 2020 release of Season 4 (partly due to the new pre-load feature and the COVID-19 lockdown)."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/20\/08\/04\/apple-details-ios-14-requirements-for-default-third-party-browsers-email-clients","domain":"appleinsider.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 00:13:32","title":"Apple details iOS 14 requirements for default third-party browsers, email clients","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/photos5.appleinsider.com\/gallery\/37007-69242-200803-iOS14-xl.jpg","content":"Apple in a recently published support document outlined code configurations, special restrictions and settings developers need to implement in order to offer apps as default alternatives to Safari and Mail in iOS 14.\n\nWhen iOS 14 debuts this fall, users will for the first time be able to replace Apple's default Safari and Mail apps with third-party options. Developers must adhere to Apple's rules to be eligible for consideration as an alternative.\n\nDetailed in a support document, spotted by MacStories' Federico Viticci on Monday, Apple's guidelines note third-party apps must meet certain criteria before being considered as system defaults.\n\nAs it applies to web browser apps, eligible titles must meet functional benchmarks, provide adequate user privacy and ensure proper access to internet resources, Apple says. Apps must specify HTTP and HTTPS schemes in its Info.plist file and can't use UIWebView. On launch, the app must provide a text field for entering a URL, search tools or a \"curated\" list of bookmarks, the docuemnt reads.\n\nWhen opening a URL, a default app must \"navigate directly to the specified destination and render the expected web content.\" One exception to that rule is support for parental control or \"locked down\" modes that restrict web navigation.\n\nThird-party apps can also present a \"Safe Browsing\" or other warning when online content is suspected of phishing or other safety issues. Apps with proper entitlements are unable to respond to Universal Links for specific domains, Apple says, adding that the special links can be opened to other apps.\n\nTo protect users, browsers will be rejected if they are found to be illicitly accessing photo files, location (including always-on location access), HomeKit databases, or health databases. Apps that poll for Bluetooth devices while running in the background will also be denied.\n\nMail apps must follow a relatively short list of directives that includes correct scheme specification in a plist file and the ability to send and receive messages from any valid email recipient. Apple notes that apps can implement user-controlled mail screening features, like those offered by Basecamp's new Hey email service."},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.inverse.com\/gaming\/fall-guys-105-update-patch-notes-jump-showdown","domain":"inverse.com","published_date":"2020-08-13 18:10:00","title":"'Fall Guys' update 1.05 patch notes finally reintroduce Jump Showdown","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/imgix.bustle.com\/uploads\/image\/2020\/8\/13\/9f1bb192-8036-438e-a5db-81514032d38f-2020-08-13.png?w=400&h=300&fit=crop&crop=faces&q=50&dpr=2","content":"The latest battle royale game phenomenon, Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout, is a total hit thanks to being this month's PS Plus freebie, and it just got its first major update on August 13.\n\nNot only did this first big patch add a brand new level and many quality of life improvements like bug fixes, but it paved the way for a fun and silly future. If you want to know what this patch added and what else Mediatonic and Devolver Digital want to add to Fall Guys in the future, we have you covered.\n\nFall Guys update 1.05 patch notes\n\nThe patch notes for Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout's first update were revealed on Twitter August 11 ahead of its intended Wednesday launch. Due to a last-minute fix, the patch was delayed from August 12 to August 13 and went live around 11 a.m. Eastern on Thursday. Now that the patch is live, here's what it includes.\n\nThe first major update for Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout released on August 13, 2020. Devolver Digital\n\nAll of the promised changes were made, including the reintroduction of a returning game mode from the beta: Jump Showdown . In addition, various other bug fixes and balances changes were made, including a fix for a prevalent bug that made some Fall Mountain matches unbeatable if the Crown at the end was ungrabbable.\n\nThese are the official patch notes released for Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout's first update on Twitter:\n\nJump Showdown - A Fan favorite from the beta\n\nLowered the weighting for Royal Fumble to add more final round variation\n\nFixed crash at launch with certain regional calendars set in the operating system\n\nImproved messaging for matchmaking and server errors\n\nFixed physics behaving erratically at high framerates on levels like Tip Toe\n\nFixed crown in Fall Mountain not being grabbable in rare situations\n\nAddressed some collisions in Block Party allowing players to bypass the blocks\n\nFixed Parties sometimes failing due to too many requests\n\nAddressed some special characters causing display issues in player names\n\nFixed Big Tease Achievement not unlocking in specific regions\n\nPC only - Fixed certain game controller models not being detected on PC\n\nWhat other updates are coming to Fall Guys?\n\nWhile this update was mainly focused on one new mode and several bug fixes, future updates will add more substantial new levels, features, and costumes to Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout. Senior Designer Joe Walsh delved into what some of these features will be in an interview with MinnMax on August 12.\n\n\"A big thing we're definitely looking into is cross-play,\" Walsh explained. \"Fall Guys is about bringing people together to play wholesome games and it makes sense that cross-play is part of that.\" They also confirmed that Mediatonic is looking into adding a Squads mode to Fall Guys where players can \"win or lose as teams,\" as well as conceptualizing \"what does Season 2 look like.\"\n\nThe Inverse Analysis \u2014 Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout's biggest problem is that the modes can get repetitive after a while, so it's encouraging to see the developers add a new game mode so quickly after the game has become a hit, doubly so that they've confirmed plans for even more. While bug fixes are always somewaht less exciting, they're an essential part of any live-service game and will also make the game a smoother experience for everyone.\n\nUltimately, what should excite players the most is Walsh's ultimate goal with Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout: \"We see the best version of Fall Guys as where you press go and there are 100 variations of that first level.\""},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2020\/08\/11\/android-auto-navigation-apps\/","domain":"9to5google.com","published_date":"2020-08-11 13:00:00","title":"Android Auto finally opens up to more navigation apps","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2019\/07\/android_auto_5_google_maps.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=1600","content":"Google\u2019s Android Auto platform continues to expand with more apps, supported hardware, and even its native version arriving on other cars.

This satisfies most users, but understandably it\u2019s frustrating for some and also prevents choice. Now, Google has opened up the floodgates.\n\nIn early access for the time being, Google is allowing more navigation apps to work with Android Auto. This starts with partners such as TomTom, MapFactor, and others. Along with more navigation apps, Google is also allowing new apps for parking and electric vehicle charging. SpotHero, for example, is another early access partner for these new categories.\n\nToday, we\u2019re showcasing our work with early access partners to build apps in new categories for Android Auto, including navigation, parking and electric vehicle charging. Using our new Android for Cars App Library, we\u2019re able to ensure that all tasks within an app can be achieved with minimal glances or taps.\n\nAt a time where Google is under increased scrutiny for competition, it\u2019s especially good to see this change being made. Early access partners will have their apps available for beta testers by the end of this year. If all goes well, Google says that these APIs will be made public in the future.\n\nAlong with the arrival of these new forms of apps, Google has confirmed that Android Auto has 3,000 apps in the Play Store and optmized for the platform.\n\nMore on Android Auto:"},{"topic":"TECHNOLOGY","link":"https:\/\/www.airforce-technology.com\/news\/northrop-grumman-gem-63xl-rocket-motor-ula\/","domain":"airforce-technology.com","published_date":"2020-08-14 09:31:00","title":"Northrop Grumman tests GEM 63XL rocket motor for ULA","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.airforce-technology.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/6\/2020\/08\/Northrop-Grumman-14thAug.jpg","content":"Northrop Grumman conducted the first test of its GEM 63XL rocket motor to serve the United Launch Alliance Vulcan Centaur.

TCL today announced new TVs for 2020 in its 5-series and 6-series lineup. All of these TVs use Roku TV, and for the first time, TCL says that it's using QLED tech in its 5-series lineup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn all, TCL says that QLED tech will be featured in three of the five TV lineups it's offering this year, which likely means that we won't see it in the 4-series and 3-series. In any case, the new TVs TCL is introducing today output in 4K resolution and support Dolby Vision HDR. They'll also use TCL's own AiPQ engine to bolster HDR, 4K upscaling, and contrast.\n\nThat seems to cover the similarities, but of course, there are some key differences between the two series as well. In the 6-series, for instance, we'll see TCL use mini-LED backlighting to give the three TVs \"up to 240 contrast control zones,\" compared to the 80 control zones in the 5-series with its standard LED backlighting.\n\nThe TVs in the 6-series will support Dolby Atmos sound and a THX-certified game mode, which promises a variable refresh rate that ranges from 48Hz to 120Hz. The game mode on these TVs also touts \"low-latency\" gaming, but in looking at the spec sheet for the 6-series TVs, we couldn't find any mention of input lag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs far as the 5-series is concerned, it seems that these are the the TVs for those who don't mind a somewhat diminished feature set in return for a lower price tag. Though the TVs in this series still use quantum dot tech and Dolby Vision, they don't use Dolby Atmos and they don't seem to support the THX Game Mode found in the 6-series. As previously stated, they also have fewer contrast zones than the 6-series, so that's something to keep in mind if you're interested in picking up one of these TVs.\n\nThe 6-series is launching in limited availability beginning today, with a total of three models in the lineup: 55 inches ($649.99), 65 inches ($899.99) and 75 inches ($1,399.99). The 5-series, on the other hand, has a grand total of four models: 50 inches ($399.99), 55 inches ($449.99), 65 inches ($629.99) and 75 inches ($1,099.99). All TVs in the 5-series are presently available \"from your favorite retailer\" according to TCL."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/india\/us-relaxes-travel-advisory-but-india-still-on-no-go-list\/articleshow\/77424979.cms","domain":"timesofindia.indiatimes.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 23:08:00","title":"US relaxes travel advisory, but India still on no-go list","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.toiimg.com\/thumb\/msid-77425089,imgsize-44990,width-400,resizemode-4\/77425089.jpg","content":"WASHINGTON: The US has lifted the highest level of its global health travel advisory for Americans due to the coronavirus pandemic and restored the previous country-specific system without changing the status of over 50 countries, including that of India and China.The US state department had issued the Level 4: Do Not Travel advisory on March 19, urging American citizens not to travel overseas due to the pandemic.In its latest travel advisory on India issued on Thursday, the state department said: \u201cDo not travel to India due to Covid-19. Exercise increased caution in India due to crime and terrorism.\u201d The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a level 3 (avoid non-essential travel) travel health notice for India, it said.Travellers to India may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures and other emergency conditions within India, it said.The CDC has similarly removed its level 3 Global Covid-19 Pandemic Notice. This important change reflects the reality that health and safety conditions are improving in some countries while potentially deteriorating in others, said assistant secretary of state for consular affairs Carl Risch.By returning to the country-specific travel advisory system, the US is able to give Americans detailed and actionable information to make informed travel decisions, said .\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic poses significant risks for travellers and our destination-specific advisories take into account the latest data and public health and safety analysis on Covid-related risks,\u201d Risch said.

It\u2019s a get out [\u2026]\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN President Cyril Ramaphosa has responded to loud calls for intervening in strife-torn neighbouring Zimbabwe by sending special envoys to Harare in another mediation effort since the one led by former President Thabo Mbeki which culminated in a government of national unity between Zanu PF and the MDCs in 2009. It\u2019s a get out of jail free card, but don\u2019t bet on President Emmerson Mnangagwa making use of it, such is the man\u2019s propensity for failing even the most basic tasks. To use a football analogy, this is a penalty for Mnangagwa, just don\u2019t count on him scoring. For a man who got into power through a coup that toppled long-time ruler, the late President Robert Mugabe in November 2017 and still escaped without censure from the international community \u2014 this is the perfect chance for Mnangagwa to be sincere and practical. The international community perhaps got a clue from the majority of citizens who were generally supportive of his ascendancy to power after years of oppression and torture under Mugabe. Zimbabwean people had become tired of Mugabe rule. They were desperate for a new leader and understandably they rooted for Mnangagwa whom they hoped would be different from his predecessor. The international community too, appeared to be supportive of the Zanu PF leader, especially with his \u201cZimbabwe is open for business\u201d mantra. But Mnangagwa has messed up his image barely two years into his rule. Perception is what politics and political communication is all about and Mnangagwa only has himself to blame for failing to manage his perception both in and outside Zimbabwe. The hotly disputed 2018 elections against MDC Alliance president Nelson Chamisa continues to haunt him despite the Constitutional Court having declared him the duly-elected President of the Republic. While it is generally accepted that no elections can be said to be free and fair, they must at least satisfy the minimum internationally acclaimed standards of a free and fair election. Zimbabwe\u2019s elections since the emergence of the MDC have been blighted by allegations of rigging, including violence and intimidation by the ruling government through deployment of soldiers and other State apparatus of violence. The events of August 1, 2018, where six civilians were shot to death by armed soldiers coupled with the death of 17 more civilians in the demonstrations in January last year, have all discredited Mnangagwa\u2019s leadership. Now the seconding of envoys \u2014 former South African Vice-President Baleka Mbete and ex-Security minister Sydney Mufamadi to investigate the problems confronting Zimbabweans after the arrest of journalists Hopewell Chin\u2019ono and Transform Zimbabwe leader Jacob Ngarivhume and persecution of several other opposition party officials and activists is a window of opportunity for Mnangagwa to make a firm commitment to take a totally different path in his governance of the country. He has to seize the opportunity to show the mediators in the crisis that he is willing to embrace democracy and reform. It doesn\u2019t just have to be mere words of commitment, but an acknowledgement that the path he has been travelling was a suppression of fundamental rights and that he stands ready to change all that. He has to put it in black and white. After all, he is the major beneficiary. He has everything to gain by simply acknowledging that he has dragged the country to deplorable levels worse than during Mugabe\u2019s era."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.cp24.com\/news\/tropical-storm-isaias-makes-its-way-through-quebec-with-strong-winds-and-rain-1.5051585","domain":"cp24.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 11:33:00","title":"Tropical storm Isaias makes its way through Quebec, with strong winds and rain","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.cp24.com\/resizer\/v2\/C6KLEDSJKLQDQ5KKSTLQHUWC5E.jpg?smart=true&auth=c3583e87c7301c1396685e65ec1c612fcb84e1e65197f1fc4a96a004c2d2cc76&width=800&height=450","content":"The Toronto Raptors are inching closer to being totally healthy, just days before their home opener."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.malaysiakini.com\/news\/537156","domain":"malaysiakini.com","published_date":"2020-08-03 08:33:00","title":"Ex-1MDB CEO claims PMO involved in negotiating IPIC guarantee deal","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.newscdn.net\/publisher-c1a3f893382d2b2f8a9aa22a654d9c97\/2020\/08\/d1d066a1488b2bf5af3739a71e06a5e6.jpg=s800","content":"1MDB TRIAL | Former 1MDB chief executive officer Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi claimed that the Prime Minister's Office was involved in negotiating a guarantee by Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC) on 1MDB bonds arranged by Goldman Sachs in 2012.\n\nTestifying in former prime minister Najib Abdul Razak's RM2.28 billion 1MDB graft trial, he said IPIC was to guarantee an RM1.75 billion bond which 1MDB raised in part to purchase power assets belonging to Genting Bhd's energy unit..."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.smh.com.au\/world\/north-america\/epstein-s-ex-girlfriend-ghislaine-maxwell-balks-at-prison-conditions-20200814-p55loe.html","domain":"smh.com.au","published_date":"2020-08-13 23:40:00","title":"Epstein's ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell complains about prison conditions","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/static.ffx.io\/images\/$zoom_0.501%2C$multiply_0.5855%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_309\/t_crop_custom\/q_86%2Cf_auto\/9c146a5f14751fdd3145625f1a52e25a69182738","content":"New York: The reaction of federal prison officials to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s suicide last year is to blame for onerous conditions a British socialite faces in jail while awaiting trial on charges that she procured teenage girls for him to abuse a quarter-century ago, her lawyers say.\n\nThrough the lawyers, Ghislaine Maxwell, 58, has asked a judge to help improve her treatment in a Brooklyn federal jail, saying \"uniquely onerous conditions\" limit her computer access and frustrate her ability to prepare for a trial scheduled for next July.\n\nAudrey Strauss, acting US attorney for the Southern District of New York, at a news conference to announce charges against Ghislaine Maxwell in July.

Officials did not name the brand.\n\nHealth authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have said the possibility of catching the virus through food is low.\n\nShenzhen health authorities immediately traced and tested people who might have come into contact with the product, and all results came back negative; all related products in stock have been sealed off and tested negative, the statement said.\n\nAuthorities are now tracing related products from the same brand that have already been sold, and have disinfected the area where the contaminated chicken wings were stored.\n\nThe Brazilian Association of Animal Protein (ABPA) said in a statement that it is analyzing the incident and reiterated that \"there is no scientific evidence that meat transmits the virus.\"\n\n\"It is not yet clear when the packaging was contaminated, and whether it occurred during the export transportation process,\" ABPA added.\n\nThe Brazilian agriculture ministry released a note stating that it has not been officially notified by Chinese authorities of the incident.\n\nBrazil has so far reported more than 3.1 million coronavirus cases, the second highest in the world after the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally.\n\nNews of the contaminated chicken wings comes a day after coronavirus was found on the packaging of shrimps imported from Ecuador, another South American country, at a restaurant in eastern Anhui province during a routine inspection, China's state broadcaster CCTV reported.\n\nSince July, there have been seven instances where the virus was detected on the packaging of imported seafood products across the country, from Shandong province on the eastern coast to the municipality of Chongqing in the west, according to state media reports.\n\nThese incidents have sparked concerns over the safety of imported foods. Chinese health authorities have repeatedly told the public to be cautious about buying imported meat and seafood. On Chinese social media, some have called for the suspension of all frozen food imports.\n\n'NO EVIDENCE' OF FOOD TRANSMISSION\n\nThe WHO says it is \"highly unlikely that people can contract COVID-19 from food or food packaging.\" According to the CDC, the risk of infection by the virus from food products, food packaging, or bags is \"thought to be very low.\"\n\nBoth organizations point out that the coronavirus spreads mostly person to person through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.\n\nWhile it is possible to catch COVID-19 by touching a surface or object -- including food or food packaging that has the virus on it -- and then touching your mouth, nose, or possibly eyes, it is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, according to the CDC.\n\n\"There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply,\" the WHO says.\n\nDavid Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the imported food products that tested positive in China were almost certain to have been contaminated during packaging.\n\nBut he said it doesn't necessarily mean that they're infectious -- the nucleic acid tests could be picking up the RNA of dead virus. These remnants of the virus are known to have caused false positive results on patients who have recovered from the coronavirus, such as in South Korea.\n\nIf the virus taken from the food products can be grown in labs, however, then they are infectious, he said, adding that the coronavirus can survive freezing temperatures and still be active when thawed.\n\nSTEPPED UP SCREENING\n\nChinese authorities have increased screening of imported meat and seafood products since June, when a coronavirus outbreak in Beijing emerged from the city's largest wholesale food market.\n\nState media reported at the time that the virus was discovered on a chopping board used for imported salmon at the market, prompting supermarkets in the Chinese capital to remove salmon from their shelves.\n\nBut officials at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have tried to allay concerns. \"We cannot conclude that salmon is the source of infection just because novel coronavirus was detected on a chopping board of a seller,\" Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, told the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.\n\nWu said the chopping board could instead have been contaminated by an infected owner or customers, or other products that carried the virus.\n\nIn July, a fresh coronavirus outbreak in the city of Dalian in northern China's Liaoning province was linked to a seafood company, which processes both imported and domestic seafood."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/uk-news\/pet-owners-warned-green-slime-22489396","domain":"mirror.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-08 11:04:00","title":"Pet owners warned of green slime in heatwave which could kill dogs in 15 minutes","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk\/incoming\/article22489443.ece\/ALTERNATES\/n615\/0_NHP_MDG_3x1pNfk6sgQm3mVQVOIT_18439JPG.jpg","content":"Pet owners warned of green slime in heatwave which could kill dogs in 15 minutes\n\nUK dog owners are being warned about a deadly green slime blooming in the hot weather which could kill their pet in 15 minutes.\n\nLakes and ponds across the country are being swamped by a toxic blue-green algae called cyanobacteria.\n\nIn long periods of high temperatures it multiplies and forms vast, deadly carpets on the surface.\n\nDogs leaping into the water who swallow it or lick it off their coats could die within quarter of an hour.\n\nSymptoms of exposure can appear within a few minutes or hours, depending on the type of toxin ingested, and commonly include: vomiting, diarrhoea, drooling, disorientation, trouble breathing, seizures and blood in faeces.\n\nExperts say that while not all blue green algae are poisonous, it is impossible to tell the difference visually so are urging pet owners to take care.\n\nIf left untreated, it can cause liver damage and ultimately be rapidly fatal.\n\nImage: Facebook) Facebook)\n\nThe Cotswold Water Park holiday hotspot near Swindon has posted notices urging owners to keep their pets on short leads.\n\nThe bacteria has hit other popular tourist lakes in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire including Neigh Bridge Country Park.\n\nThe Blue Cross animal charity warned \"Blooms of blue-green algae can produce harmful toxins which stop a dog's liver from functioning properly.\n\n\"Sadly, exposure to toxic blue-green algae is often fatal, and can also cause long term health problems in dogs that survive after drinking or swimming in algae-contaminated water.\n\n\"Some types of blue-green algae can kill a dog just 15 minutes to an hour after drinking contaminated water.\n\n\"Dogs who have been swimming in water can get the algae caught in their fur, and can ingest it while cleaning themselves later on.\n\nImage: Facebook) Facebook)\n\n\"Concentrations of the algae vary throughout the year and may not always be harmful -

A cold and dark winter's morning in October 1993, and the world\u2019s press found itself once again as uncomfortable bystanders in the beautiful old graveyard in Greysteele in Co Derry.\n\nAnother victim of the Rising Sun pub massacre was being buried.\n\nAll funerals are sad, but there was something particularly upsetting and poignant about this one. All around the graveyard women and men were crying.\n\nEven by the standards of Northern Ireland, it had been a dreadful few weeks. Just days before the Greysteele massacre where seven men were murdered by the loyalist UDA, the Frizzell\u2019s fish shop atrocity took place where an IRA bomb blew up ten people.\n\nThe tit-for-tat sectarian killings were pushing the North slowly but surely back into hell, and all hope in the fledgling peace process seemed at that moment to be lost forever.\n\nSuddenly I saw him.\n\nI spotted John Hume across the graveyard. His wife Pat was standing beside him.\n\nI could not stop looking at him wondering what was going through his mind at that moment.\n\nThen I noticed a woman go up to him and start to speak to both John and Pat. Within moments, John started to weep uncontrollably and the woman immediately comforted him in her arms. I always remember how she touched the side of his face to try to ease his pain. But John continued to cry.\n\nI found out later that the woman was a relative of one of the victims and that she had gone up to John to ask him to not give up, to keep on going, to not lose heart. She explained that the night before as they had prayed around the coffin, they had prayed for John, and prayed that he would continue his work for peace.\n\nLike all great peacemakers, even through those darkest days, he did not turn his back on peace, he did not give up.\n\nShortly after this funeral, John Hume was hospitalised for stress.\n\nPat Hume has since told me that around this time she asked John to stop, to give it all up, to step away, as the toll it was taking on them and their young family was simply too much. This was her breaking point.\n\nPat Hume, one of the finest women I have ever had the privilege to meet, had been enduring years of abuse and intimidation from both sides as her husband had been pursuing peace - their home in Derry was firebombed and she told me once how she regularly had to go out and scrub off the graffiti 'Traitor Hume' from the side of their house.\n\nJohn, of course, did not give up. He listened to the woman in the graveyard and as soon as he got out of hospital, he kept on going. Like all great peacemakers, even through those darkest days, he did not turn his back on peace, he did not give up. He would find a way out of the darkness.\n\nIt continued though to be a very long, lonely and difficult journey. Making peace is never easy, as he often told me. From his early days as a civil rights activist, he knew this was never going to be an easy task - but he made it his life\u2019s mission to bring peace to this island of ours.\n\nWhen I think back now, I often feel guilty as it was made all the more difficult by journalists like myself, who constantly questioned and undermined his motives and his methods.\n\nWhen it became public knowledge that he was in secret talks with Gerry Adams, he was attacked and vilified from all sides, including all of us in the media. But he never wavered from his path to peace - his absolute belief that it was worth talking to anyone and everyone, if the ultimate prize was peace.\n\nFriends of his have often told me that that doggedness, that 'stickability' as they call it, that unflinching logic and determination to pursue his mission towards peace - truly infuriating they say at times - was honed during his days as a young man training to be a priest in Maynooth.\n\nAlso the fact that his great-grandfather Willie Hume was a Scottish Protestant stonemason and came to help build the Derry rail line through Donegal and fell madly in love with John\u2019s Catholic great-grandmother and never left, meant that deep rooted in John\u2019s DNA, was a belief passionately held, that difference needs to be respected and not feared.\n\nJohn Hume, Albert Reynolds and Dick Spring pictured outside Government Buildings in 1993\n\nYears later, the three strands approach to peace on this island, that was eventually enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement, was really all about that. It was rooted in equality, agreement and respect for difference.\n\nI remember so well the day of the Good Friday Agreement - I was presenting Prime Time from Belfast, and it was such an emotional moment for all of us working that day on the team.\n\nHistoric is a word that is abused, misused and overused, but this was the most historic moment any of us had ever witnessed. We knew this was a moment that would change not just the course of Irish history, but also all of our lives forever. My first guest in studio that night was John Hume - what a privilege.\n\nSo when I was asked to champion John Hume years later for a public vote on Ireland\u2019s greatest person, living or dead, I - of course - jumped at the chance.\n\nIt was in 2010, that John Hume was voted Ireland\u2019s Greatest by the Irish public. It really should not have mattered, but it did.\n\nThe man who had achieved so much in his life and had rightfully received endless plaudits and awards including the Nobel Peace Prize, surely did not need any more confirmation of his importance to this small but proud nation?\n\nBut this award did matter and it mattered greatly to him and to his family because this was a public vote. This was a chance for all of us Irish to tell John Hume just how we felt about what he had done for all of us, and in a very small way, for the people of Ireland to say thank you John, thank you.\n\nDavid Trimble and John Hume accepting their Nobel Peace Prize in 1998\n\nI think back today on how lucky and privileged I was to know John Hume, even just a little. As a reporter covering the peace process in the 1990s, I regularly interviewed him along with many other political leaders involved in the attempts to broker a lasting peace deal on this island.\n\nJohn Hume though, for me anyway, always stood out from the crowd. Like his hero Martin Luther King, he championed civil rights and was a life long believer in non violence.\n\nJohn Hume set it as his life\u2019s mission and ambition to achieve peace in our country, and he never gave up. He sacrificed almost everything for us.\n\nHe always believed that the root of the problem was not a divided island, but rather a divided people, and through dialogue and agreement, he changed not just the course of Irish history, but all of our lives forever. We should all be eternally grateful and in a small way, I think the Ireland\u2019s Greatest public vote, was our way of showing that.\n\nI leave you with the words of John as he collected the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998: \"All conflict is about difference, whether the difference is race, religion or nationality.\n\n\"Difference is an accident of birth and it should therefore never be the source of hatred or conflict. The answer to difference, is to respect it. Therein lies the most fundamental principle of peace - respect for diversity.\"\n\nCodladh s\u00e1mh John.

More than 70 people were killed and 3,000 injured, with bodies buried in the rubble, officials said.\n\nIt was not clear what caused the blast, which struck with the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake, according to Germany\u2019s geosciences center GFZ, and was heard and felt as far away as Cyprus more than 200 kilometers (180 miles) across the Mediterranean. Lebanon\u2019s interior minister said it appeared that a large cache of ammonium nitrate in the port had detonated.\n\nThe sudden devastation overwhelmed a country already struggling with both the coronavirus pandemic and a severe economic and financial crisis.\n\nFor hours after the explosion, the most destructive in all of Lebanon\u2019s troubled history, ambulances rushed in from around the country to carry away the wounded. Hospitals quickly filled beyond capacity, pleading for blood supplies, and generators to keep their lights on.\n\nFor blocks around the port, bloodied residents staggered through streets lined with overturned cars and littered with rubble from shattered buildings. Windows and doors were blown out kilometers (miles) away, including at the city\u2019s only international airport. Army helicopters helped battle fires raging at the port.\n\nInterior Minister Mohammed Fahmi told a local TV station that it appeared the blast was caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse at the dock ever since it was confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014. Witnesses reported seeing an orange cloud like that which appears when toxic nitrogen dioxide gas is released after an explosion involving nitrates.\n\nVideos showed what appeared to be a fire erupting nearby just before, and local TV stations reported that a fireworks warehouse was involved. The fire appeared to spread to a nearby building, triggering the more massive explosion, sending up a mushroom cloud and generating a shock wave.\n\nCharbel Haj, who works at the port, said the blast started as small explosions like firecrackers. Then, he said, he was thrown off his feet.\n\nThe explosion came amid ongoing tensions between Israel and the Hezbollah military group on Lebanon\u2019s southern border. Many residents reported hearing planes overhead just before the blast, fueling rumors of an attack, though Israeli military overflights are common.\n\nAn Israeli government official said Israel \u201chad nothing to do\u201d with the blast. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with the news media. Israeli officials usually do not comment on \u201cforeign reports.\u201d The Israeli government offered emergency assistance through international intermediaries.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. \u201cstands ready to assist Lebanon,\u201d and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo extended his \u201cdeepest condolences.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur team in Beirut has reported to me the extensive damage to a city and a people that I hold dear, an additional challenge in a time of already deep crisis,\u201d Pompeo said in a written statement.\n\nThe blast was stunning even for a city that has seen a 15-year civil war, suicide bombings, bombardment by Israel and political assassinations.\n\n\u201cIt was a real horror show. I haven\u2019t seen anything like that since the days of the (civil) war,\u201d said Marwan Ramadan, who was about 500 meters (yards) from the port and was knocked off his feet by the force of the explosion.\n\nHealth Minister Hassan Hamad said the preliminary toll was more than 70 dead and more than 3,000 wounded. He added that hospitals were barely coping and offers of aid were pouring in from Arab states and friends of Lebanon.\n\nBeirut\u2019s governor, Marwan Abboud, broke into tears as he toured the site, exclaiming, \u201cBeirut is a devastated city.\u201d Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed that \u201cthose responsible will pay.\u201d\n\nAt the start of a White House news conference on the coronavirus, Trump said the explosion \u201clooks like a terrible attack.\u201d When asked by a reporter if he was confident that it was an attack, Trump said: \u201cI met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that it was.\u201d\n\nBut one of Israel\u2019s top bomb experts, Boaz Hayoun, said fireworks could have been a factor setting off the bigger blast. \u201cBefore the big explosion \u2026 in the center of the fire, you can see sparks, you can hear sounds like popcorn and you can hear whistles,\u201d said Hayoun, owner of the Tamar Group, which works closely with the Israeli government on safety and certification issues involving explosives. \u201cThis is very specific behavior of fireworks.\u201d\n\nSome of those injured lay on the ground at the port, Associated Press staff at the scene said. A civil defense official said there were still bodies inside the port, many under debris.\n\nSeveral of Beirut\u2019s hospitals were damaged in the blast. Outside the St. George University Hospital in Beirut\u2019s Achrafieh neighborhood, people with various injuries arrived in ambulances, in cars and on foot. The explosion had caused major damage inside the building and knocked out the electricity. Dozens of injured were being treated on the spot on the street outside, on stretchers and wheelchairs.\n\nOutside one hospital, Omar Kinno sat on the pavement, holding back tears. Kinno, a Syrian, said one of his sisters was killed when the blast rocked their apartment near the port, and another sister\u2019s neck was broken. His injured mother and father were taken to a hospital but he didn\u2019t know which, and he was making calls trying to track them down.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what happened to my parents. I am totally lost,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said one of its ships in the port was damaged and a number of its peacekeepers were injured, some seriously.\n\nConfusion reigned across the city, as people cleared out of damaged homes or tried to locate family. Motorcyclists picked their way through traffic, carrying the injured.\n\nOne woman covered in blood from the waist up walked down a trashed street while talking furiously on her phone. On another street, a woman with a bloodied face looked distraught, staggering through traffic with two friends at her side.\n\n\u201cThis country is cursed,\u201d a young man passing by muttered.\n\nThe blast came at a time when Lebanon\u2019s economy is facing collapse from the financial crisis and the coronavirus restrictions. Many have lost jobs, while the worth of their savings has evaporated as the currency has plunged in value against the dollar. The result has thrown many into poverty and has put thousands out of their homes.\n\nThe explosion also raises concerns about how Lebanon will continue to import nearly all of its vital goods with its main port devastated.\n\nThe explosion \u2014 reminiscent of the massive blasts that often erupted during Lebanon\u2019s civil war \u2014 happened only three days before a U.N.-backed tribunal was set to give its verdict in the killing of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in a truck bombing more than 15 years ago. That explosion, with a ton of explosives, was felt kilometers (miles) away, just as Tuesday\u2019s was.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said in a tweet that his country was sending aid. Iran, Hezbollah\u2019s patron, also said it was ready to help. \u201cStay strong, Lebanon,\u201d its foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said in a tweet.\n\nCredit : Associated Press (AP) | Photo Credit : (AP)"},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2020\/08\/rebels-kill-police-kashmir-india-independence-day-200814081719467.html","domain":"aljazeera.com","published_date":"2020-08-14 08:47:00","title":"Rebels kill police in Kashmir ahead of India's Independence Day","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/db45ab3a1876403192c6d9a058367b65_18.jpeg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80","content":"A group of fighters opened fire on the police team in Srinagar city, killing two policemen, a top official said.\n\nRebels attacked a police team in Indian-administered Kashmir on Friday, killing two officers and wounding one despite tight security in the disputed majority-Muslim region ahead of India\u2019s Independence Day.\n\nA group of fighters opened fire on the police team that was on duty in the Nowgam area of Srinagar city, the chief of police in Kashmir, Vijay Kumar, told the Reuters news agency.\n\n\u201cWe had inputs that militants may carry out attack and were alert,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cThey came through a narrow lane and fired indiscriminately.\u201d\n\nHe said the rebels had been identified and promised to \u201cneutralise them\u201d soon.

I know he's ready to lead the charge forward in our fight for a fairer and healthier city for all.\"\n\nThe Mayor said at a news conference that Dr Chokshi has an \"extraordinary history\" and as a child of immigrants, grew up with tremendous potential, and worked hard every step of the way to realise that potential.\n\nDr Chokshi recalled that opportunity propelled his grandfathers to move from small villages in Gujarat to Mumbai two generations ago.\n\nHis father was the first in his family to immigrate to the United States, settling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he was born and raised.\n\nA Rhodes Scholar, he has served as a White House Fellow in the Obama Administration and was the principal health advisor to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\nIn 2016, President Barack Obama appointed him to the Advisory Group on Prevention, Health Promotion, and Integrative and Public Health.\n\n\"I couldn't be prouder of our City's response in the face of a once-in-a-lifetime public health crisis,\" Dr Chokshi said, adding that he was honoured to serve the people of New York City.\n\n\"Together, we will emerge from this pandemic as a stronger, fairer, and healthier city.\"\n\nNew York currently has 446,691 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 32,801 deaths due to the infection, according to worldometres.info.\n\nHe said that the COVID-19 pandemic has \"unmasked how disease, racism, and economic dislocation intersect with devastating health consequences.\n\nHe added that the epidemic is only the most recent example of the vicious cycles of illness and inequity that he has seen over his career.\n\n\"Each of those experiences further forged my conviction that we must build toward better health systems with prevention at the center and a more proactive approach to avoidable human suffering.\"\n\n\"We are in a better place with COVID-19 than we were this spring thanks to the efforts of New Yorkers, the administration, the Health Department, and Health + Hospitals....The role of public health is central and clear.

But a popular Japanese restaurant chain is banking on diners in India to acquire a taste for its signature dish: curry.\n\nCoCo Ichibanya, which has become a staple of the Japanese budget dining scene since it opened its first outlet in 1978, this week launched its first restaurant in India, near Delhi.\n\nThe dishes will cater to local cultural and religious beliefs, with pork and beef curries that are popular in Japan replaced by those made with chicken, seafood and vegetables, the company said.\n\nIchibanya operates 1,447 outlets in Japan and 12 overseas, including China, Thailand and Indonesia, and hopes to open as many as 30 restaurants in India by 2030, according to the Nikkei business newspaper. It opened a branch in London in late 2018.\n\nIndian diners expecting authentic flavours and spicing will be disappointed. The chain\u2019s curry bases are soupier, sweeter affairs than the average biryani or dhal, with diners invited to select toppings and spice level, from an innocuous mild to eye-watering level 10.\n\nThe early indications are that Ichibanya\u2019s decision to court the potentially huge Indian market could pay off. The Kyodo news agency quoted one local man as saying that he and his compatriots welcomed the chance to try other countries\u2019 takes on their national dish.\n\n\u201cIndian people who have visited our outlets in Japan said our curry tastes good,\u201d Hirosuke Nakamura, the chief operating officer of the joint venture, said before the opening, according to the Jiji news agency. While acknowledging that Japanese style is different from its Indian counterpart, he added: \u201cWe think our curry will be accepted.\u201d\n\nThe move had also gone down well with Japanese expatriates queuing outside the restaurant when it opened on Monday in a shopping mall in Gurugram, south-west of the Indian capital.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve eaten CoCo curry for three years,\u201d Shinji Ieki, who works for a Japanese company in the Indian capital, told Kyodo news agency. \u201cComing here is going to be something to look forward to.\u201d\n\nWhile katsu curry is familiar to diners in the UK and US, Japan\u2019s obsession with curry is perhaps less well known than its appetite for sushi, sashimi and ramen.\n\nThe Japanese have been eating curry for well over a century, and it regularly appears high in surveys of the country\u2019s favourite foods, particularly among ravenous schoolchildren.\n\nThe British navy is thought to have introduced curry to Japan in the late 19th century. Cheap and filling, kar\u0113 raisu (curry and rice) soon became a staple among Japanese sailors and soldiers.\n\nOne theory has it that the flour in its spicy roux acted as an antidote to beriberi, a vitamin B-1 deficiency blamed on the overconsumption of polished white rice that had ravaged Japanese troops during the Russo-Japanese war at the start of the 20th century.\n\nThe first Japanese recipe for curry is preserved in the navy cooking reference book, published in 1908. Sailors from the imperial Japanese navy \u2013 renamed the maritime self-defence forces after the second world war \u2013 still eat curry every Friday, and restaurants in the naval port of Yokosuka serve a version made according to the original recipe.\n\nInevitably, the dish has since become a focal point for regional culinary supremacy: people in eastern Japan generally like their curry made with pork; in the west, with beef.\n\nJapanese curry aficionados include the professional baseball legend Ichiro Suzuki, who reportedly ate it before every home game when he played for the Seattle Mariners, and the former emperor Akihito."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/08\/14\/politics\/new-york-da-trump-subpoena\/index.html","domain":"cnn.com","published_date":"2020-08-14 15:27:00","title":"New York DA asks judge to dismiss Trump's new challenges to grand jury subpoena, calling them 'nonsensical'","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/190919130022-20190918-trump-tax-forms-generic.jpg?q=x_30,y_13,h_867,w_1541,c_crop\/h_833,w_1480","content":"CNN \u2014\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss President Donald Trump\u2019s challenges to a grand jury subpoena for his financial records, calling the President\u2019s claims that the investigation is limited to hush money payments as \u201cnonsensical.\u201d\n\nThe DA\u2019s office said it has repeatedly put Trump\u2019s lawyers on notice that its inquiry extends beyond the hush money payments.\n\nProsecutors did not specifically say in the court filing what it is investigating beyond the hush money payments Michael Cohen facilitated to two women who alleged affairs with the President, but they pointed, again, to numerous public allegations of possibly illegal conduct and their previous statements, including before the US Supreme Court, that their investigation was broad.\n\n\u201cGrand juries routinely issue subpoenas in an iterative process, seeking different records from different parties and from different date ranges, with later subpoenas building on new information and leads generated from returns on earlier subpoenas. In other words, the inference that any one subpoena in this case defines the investigation is simply not reasonable,\u201d the prosecutors wrote.\n\n\u201cGiven that this much information about potentially widespread and protracted criminal conduct was in the public record (and without going into any additional, non- public sources), it is not plausible to speculate, let alone infer, that the grand jury investigation was limited to Cohen\u2019s 2016 payments,\u201d the DA\u2019s office added. \u201cAs the Office said in oral argument in the Supreme Court, \u2018[the subpoena] was [prompted] by public reports that certain business transactions in our jurisdiction were possibly illegal. Given those allegations, our office would have been remiss not to follow up.\u2019\u201d\n\nLast year prosecutors subpoenaed Deutsche Bank seeking financial statements and other records it obtained over its years as one of the President\u2019s largest lenders, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The New York Times first reported the subpoena.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled last month that Trump does not have absolute immunity from a state grand jury investigation. Trump\u2019s lawyers filed an amended complaint challenging the grand jury subpoena sent to Mazars USA, Trump\u2019s long-time accounting firm, seeking eight years of personal and business records saying it is too broad and intended to harass the President.\n\nThey also asked the judge for a hearing to explore the breadth of the criminal investigation.

On Monday, one of the most high-profile enforcement of this law came with the arrest of business tycoon Jimmy Lai. Here\u2019s a low-down on everything you need to know about why Lai\u2019s case is important.\n\nHong Kong media mogul Jimmy Lai, 71, was arrested on Monday and the office of his newspaper Apple Daily was raided by police. Since protests against Hong Kong\u2019s national security law began last year, Lai has prominently supported the pro-democracy movement. Hong Kong police said Lai had been charged with \u201cviolating the territory\u2019s new national security law.\u201d\n\nLai is a citizen of the United Kingdom but was born in Guangzhou, China. According to a BBC profile, at age 12, Lai fled his village in mainland China, and reached Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat. He worked his way up from working in a Hong Kong sweatshop to starting a multi-million dollar empire in a span of a few decades, becoming one of Hong Kong\u2019s richest residents. However, Lai has also been a consistent supporter of democracy and a critic of the Chinese government and its meddling in Hong Kong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the BBC profile, Beijing\u2019s crackdown on the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square deeply influenced and shaped Lai\u2019s political views. His open criticism of China\u2019s policies, censorship, repression of the freedom of speech and the Tiananmen massacre in his writings in newspapers was a constant source of consternation for Beijing.\n\n\n\nBeijing\u2019s censorship of his bookstores in China led to Lai establishing Apple Daily and a digital magazine called Next, both of which are pro-democracy publications in Hong Kong. Already branded as a troublemaker by Beijing, Lai\u2019s meeting last year with US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had further angered China. Pro-China individuals and Beijing have consistently accused Lai of being a \u201ctraitor\u201d, a message that China\u2019s propaganda outlets have emphasised.\n\nAccording to China\u2019s Global Times, two of Lai\u2019s sons and two senior executives of Next Digital have also been arrested by Hong Kong police.\n\nAlso in Explained | How language leads to gender bias in science\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy were Lai\u2019s newspaper offices raided?\n\nLai\u2019s newspaper offices in Hong Kong have faced several attacks over the past few years, including incidents where masked attackers threw firebombs at the office complex. On Monday morning, hundreds of police officers were seen entering the office of Apple Daily and conducting a raid.\n\nLai himself was escorted out of the building wearing handcuffs. This past year, Lai was arrested twice by Hong Kong police on charges of illegal assembly for joining pro-democracy protesters. After the new national security law was enforced in Hong Kong, Lai and his newspapers had bitterly criticised the move, saying it was a \u201cdeath knell\u201d in an interview with the BBC in June.\n\nCritics say that this latest move by Hong Kong\u2019s establishment is dangerous for the state of press freedom in Hong Kong and perhaps a sign of things to come, exactly what pro-democracy activists had been fearing.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Express Explained is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@ieexplained) and stay updated with the latest\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy is Lai\u2019s arrest concerning?\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the state of press freedom in Hong Kong that is concerning for observers. When the national security law came into effect on June 30, critics were particularly concerned about a clause that said \u201cthe law will also apply to non-permanent residents and people \u201cfrom outside (Hong Kong)\u2026 who are not permanent residents of Hong Kong\u201d.\n\nUnder the clauses of this law, an individuals\u2019 foreign citizenship is not going to protect them from Beijing\u2019s long arm serving to crack down on anyone it deems a threat to its own geopolitical goals, and this became clear in the case of Lai.\n\nAfter news of Lai\u2019s arrest broke, Nigel Adams at UK\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: \u201cMedia freedom must be upheld.

But the U.S. circulated a six-page memo Thursday from State Department lawyers outlining why the United States remains part of the 2015 Security Council resolution that endorsed the deal and still has the right to use the `snap back\u2019 provision.\n\nThe five other powers \u2014 Russia, China, United Kingdom, France and Germany \u2014 remain committed to the deal, and diplomats from several of these countries have voiced concern that extending the arms embargo would lead Iran to exit the nuclear agreement and speed up its pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nChina\u2019s UN ambassador, Zhang Jun, reiterated after the vote the Chinese contention that since the U.S. is no longer party to the 2015 agreement, it is \u201cineligible to demand the Security Council invoke a snap back.\u201d He said the overwhelming majority of council members \u201cbelieve the U.S. attempt has no legal basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould the U.S. insist regardless of international opinion, it is doomed to fail like today,\u201d Zhang said in a statement, adding that the vote showed \u201cthat unilateralism receives no support and bullying will fail.\u201d\n\n6 View gallery Iranian Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi ( Photo: Twitter )\n\nIranian Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi accused the U.S. of seeking to use the arms embargo \u201cas a pretext of killing the JCPOA forever through the snap back mechanism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we have already stated, imposition of any sanctions or restrictions on Iran by the Security Council will be met severely by Iran and our options are not limited.

As such he is seeking to have the cap based on language, so that diversity can be maintained in the US.\n\n\"In being stuck with a 140,000-limit on green cards for employment visas and country caps for that 140,000 limit, we will continue to run into the problem illustrated by the Senator from Florida,\" Durbin said.\n\nCurrently, there is a backlog of almost one million foreign nationals and accompanying family members lawfully residing in the United States who have been approved for, and are waiting to receive, employment-based Green Cards. The largest number of them are from India.\n\n\"There will be those who will want to create an exception to the overall quota or the country caps, and there will be compelling, personal, and family reasons for them to ask for it. Time and again, they will find that, if they get a privilege, it will be at the expense of someone else, and there will be an objection. The only rational answer is to raise the cap on the green card quotas,\" he argued.\n\n\"These 140,000 employment-based visas a year might have made sense 30 or 40 years ago. They make no sense today in the world that we live in. We are talking about people in the United States who are working, who are trying to make lives here of a more permanent nature. They love this country enough to want to bring their families here\" to relocate and live,\" he said.\n\nSenator Scott argued that removing per country quota would be a big disadvantage to people from various countries like those from Latin America or even from China.\n\n\"I offer an amendment today to make sure we are not creating an unfair system that favors certain nations or that would disadvantage immigrants who don't happen to be from the nations that are the largest drivers of the employment-based visa backlog that we see today. I know my colleagues share my desire to preserve the diversity of our Nation, and I look forward to their accepting my amendment today,\" he said.\n\nScott said that his goal is to be fair to the many wonderful and skilled people who want to build lives in the United States.\n\nSenator Mike Lee from Utah disagreed. \"What is it about the speakers of these languages...the native speakers or speakers who hold a degree in the languages of Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian, Creole, Cantonese, Taiwanese, Hokkien, or Hakka that makes them more deserving of an allocation of an employment-based immigrant visa than the speakers of Hindi, of Urdu, or of any of the languages spoken in India?\" he asked.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly, the per-country cap punishes would-be immigrants from India in a way that doesn't affect any others, except maybe some from China. By the way, he covers some of the language groups spoken in and around China, including Cantonese and Taiwanese. So why not Mandarin? Then, if Mandarin, why not any of the languages spoken in India?\" he said taking a dig at Scott.\n\n\"Imagine two otherwise identical applicants for a visa, wherein they are exactly the same in all respects those being their academic degrees they have earned, their employment experience, their background checks, their family statuses, their earning potential, their job commitment, and professional certifications.\"\n\n\"Imagine they are identical in every single respect except for one that immigrant A happens to hail from Sweden and that immigrant B happens to have been born in India. Immigrant A will be eligible to have an employment-based immigrant visa application considered immediately. Immigrant B, simply by virtue of having come from India, will, in many circumstances, have to be on a waiting list for 200 years. This is wrong,\" Lee said.\n\nThe Senators were debating on Lee's unanimous consent request that the Senate now proceed to pass the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act (HR 1044), as passed by the House, that would eliminate the seven per cent per-country ceiling, along with his amendment. The legislation would allocate employment-based visas to prospective immigrants by application date on a first-come, first-served basis without regard to country of origin.\n\nHowever, it would not reduce the backlog because it would not increase the number of foreign nationals receiving Green Cards. As passed by the House, HR 1044 would include a three-year transition period from the current system to the new system."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.thestar.com.my\/news\/world\/2020\/08\/10\/beirut-governor-says-many-bodies-still-unidentified-from-port-blast-are-foreign-workers","domain":"thestar.com.my","published_date":"2020-08-09 21:49:00","title":"Beirut governor says many bodies still unidentified from port blast are foreign workers","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.thestar.com.my\/theme_metro\/images\/TSOL640x100.png","content":"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Many foreign workers and truck drivers are missing and assumed to be among the casualties of the Beirut port warehouse blast, complicating efforts to identity the victims, the city's governor said on Sunday.\n\n\"There are a lot missing whom we cannot identify.

He told reporters he had directed the secretary general of the supreme defence council, an umbrella group of Lebanon\u2019s security and military agencies chaired by the president, to \u201cdo what is necessary\u201d.\n\n\u201c[The state security service] said it is dangerous. I am not responsible! I don\u2019t know where it was put and I didn\u2019t know how dangerous it was. I have no authority to deal with the port directly. There is a hierarchy and all those who knew should have known their duties to do the necessary,\u201d Aoun said.\n\nMany questions remain over why the shipment of ammonium nitrate docked in Beirut in late 2013. Even more baffling is why such a huge stash of dangerous material, used in bombs and fertilisers, was allowed to remain there for so long.\n\nThe letter sent to Lebanon\u2019s president and prime minister followed a string of memos and letters sent to the country\u2019s courts over the previous six years by port, custom and security officials, repeatedly urging judges to order the removal of the ammonium nitrate from its position so close to the city centre.\n\nThe General Directorate of State Security\u2019s report seen by Reuters said many requests had been submitted, without giving an exact number. It said the port\u2019s manifest department sent several written requests to the customs directorate up until 2016 asking them to call on a judge to order the material be re-exported immediately.\n\n\u201cBut until now, no decision has been issued over this matter. After consulting one of our chemical specialists, the expert confirmed that this material is dangerous and is used to produce explosives,\u201d the General Directorate of State Security report said.\n\nHazardous material\n\nThe road to last week\u2019s tragedy began seven years ago, when the Rhosus, a Russian-chartered, Moldovan-flagged vessel carrying ammonium nitrate from Georgia to Mozambique, docked in Beirut to try to take on extra cargo to raise the fees for passage through the Suez Canal, according to the ship\u2019s captain.\n\nPort authorities impounded the Rhosus on December 2013 by judicial order 2013\/1031 due to outstanding debts owed to two companies that filed claims in Beirut courts, the state security report showed.\n\nIn May 2014, the ship was deemed unseaworthy and its cargo was unloaded in October 2014 and warehoused in what was known as Hangar 12. The ship sank near the port\u2019s breakwater on February 18, 2018, the security report showed.\n\nMoldova lists the owner of the ship as Panama-based Briarwood Corp. Briarwood could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nIn February 2015, Nadim Zwain, a judge from the Summary Affairs Court, which deals with urgent issues, appointed an expert to inspect the cargo, according to the security report.\n\nThe report said the expert concluded that the material was hazardous and, through the port authorities, requested it be transferred to the army. Reuters could not independently confirm the expert\u2019s account.\n\nLebanese army command rejected the request and recommended the chemicals be transferred or sold to the privately-owned Lebanese Explosives Company, the state security report said.\n\nThe report did not say why the army had refused to accept the cargo. A security official told Reuters it was because they didn\u2019t need it. The army declined to comment.\n\nThe explosive company\u2019s management told Reuters it had not been interested in purchasing confiscated material and that the firm had its own suppliers and government import licences.\n\nFrom then on, customs and security officials wrote to judges roughly every six months asking for the removal of the material, according to the requests seen by Reuters.\n\nJudges and customs officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment.\n\nA number of customs and port officials have since been detained as part of the investigation into the blast.\n\n\u2018Bad storage and bad judgement'\n\nIn January 2020, a judge launched an official investigation after it was discovered that Hangar 12 was unguarded, had a hole in its southern wall and one of its doors dislodged, meaning the hazardous material was at risk of being stolen.\n\nIn his final report following the investigation, Prosecutor General Oweidat \u201cgave orders immediately\u201d to ensure hangar doors and holes were repaired and security provided, a second high-ranking security official who also requested anonymity said.\n\nOn June 4, based on those orders, state security instructed port authorities to provide guards at Hangar 12, appoint a director for the warehouse and secure all the doors and repair the hole in the southern wall, according to the state security report and security officials.\n\nThe port authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cThe maintenance started and (port authorities) sent a team of Syrian workers [but] there was no one supervising them when they entered to fix the holes,\u201d the security official said.\n\nDuring the work, sparks from the welding took hold and fire started to spread, the official said.\n\n\u201cGiven that there were fireworks stored in the same hangar, after an hour a big fire was set off by the fireworks and that spread to the material that exploded when the temperature exceeded 210 degrees,\u201d the high-ranking security official said.\n\nThe official blamed the port authorities for not supervising the repair crew and for storing fireworks alongside a vast deposit of high explosives.\n\nReuters could not determine what happened to the workers repairing the hangar.\n\n\u201cOnly because the hangar faces the sea, the impact of the explosion was reduced. Otherwise, all of Beirut would have been destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue is all about negligence, irresponsibility, bad storage and bad judgment.\u201d"},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2020\/08\/10\/tech\/twitter-stock-tiktok\/index.html","domain":"cnn.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 15:56:00","title":"Twitter's rumored interest in buying TikTok sparks stock rally","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/media.cnn.com\/api\/v1\/images\/stellar\/prod\/180921145916-markets-now-logo-large-169.png?q=h_50","content":"1.

Of them, fewer than five percent led to any type of conviction, the human rights group said.\n\n\u201cThe brutality we witnessed at Marikana continues. The lack of accountability continues,\u201d SERI said in a Facebook post on Sunday marking the events eight years ago.\n\nLow levels of trust\n\nAdele Kirsten, director of Gun Free South Africa, said the Marikana anniversary is a \u201cstrategic moment\u201d to make the panel\u2019s report public.\n\nShe said its members wrote last month to the Minister of Police Bheki Cele calling for the release of the recommendations but they have not received any response.\n\n\u201cThe panel is also putting pressure on parliament,\u201d Kirsten said.\n\nAnother member of the panel, Themba Masuku, programme manager of the African Policing Civilian Oversight Forum, said: \u201cWe want the public to know the contents of the recommendations. They have a right to know what their tax money is being used for.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, a survey by Afrobarometer found that fewer people in South Africa trusted police than any other public institutions, with 66 percent of respondents saying they trusted the police \u201cnot at all\u201d or just a little\u201d (41 and 25 percent, respectively).\n\n\u201cOne of the purposes of the panel\u2019s work was that policing itself must become a positive government service,\u201d said member Gareth Newham, head of the justice and violence prevention programme at the ISS.\n\nHe added that the panel also considered the role of the top management of the police in the 2012 killings and also looked into political interference in the police.\n\nFor Lancaster, the fact that the panel \u201cprobed questions of political interference into the massacre\u201d and the involvement of politicians who still hold positions of power \u201cmeans that government is not rushing to release the recommendations\u201d.\n\nLancaster said: \u201cThe fact that the panel probed political interference during Marikana could make the release of the report a sensitive political issue since some of the political figures are still in positions of power.\u201d"},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.ndtv.com\/world-news\/after-port-blast-lebanon-has-less-than-a-months-grain-reserves-minister-2274669","domain":"ndtv.com","published_date":"2020-08-05 11:10:12","title":"After Port Blast, Lebanon Has Less Than A Month's Grain Reserves: Minister","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/c.ndtvimg.com\/2020-08\/btmpi798_beiruts-port-area-reuters-650_625x300_05_August_20.jpg?downsize=773:435","content":"Lebanon's main grain silo at Beirut port was destroyed in a blast along with the wheat inside, leaving the nation with less than a month's reserves of the grain although other vessels with supplies are on the way, the economy minister said on Wednesday.\n\nRaoul Nehme told Reuters a day after Tuesday's devastating blast that Lebanon needed reserves for at least three months to ensure food security and was looking at other storage areas.\n\nHe said reserves now stood at \"a bit less than a month\".\n\nThe explosion was the most powerful ever to rip through Beirut, leaving the port district a wreck of mangled masonry and disabling the main entry port for imports to feed a nation of more than 6 million people.\n\nThe Beirut silo was capable of holding 120,000 tonnes of grain, said Ahmed Tamer, the director of the port of Tripoli, Lebanon's second biggest city.\n\nThe port in Tripoli, Lebanon's second biggest port, is not equipped with grain storage facilities but wheat could be transferred to warehouses 2 km (about one mile) away, he said.\n\nAt the time of the blast, the Beirut silo held no more than 15,000 tonnes of wheat as some millers had unloaded cargoes directly because of a delay in issuing letters of credit for payment, Ahmed Hattit, the head of the wheat importers union, told the local Al-Akhbar newspaper.\n\nHattit said existing reserves of flour were sufficient to cover market needs for a month and a half and said there were four ships carrying cargoes totalling 28,000 tonnes of wheat that had not docked at the port yet.\n\nLebanon is trying to immediately transfer four vessels carrying 25,000 tonnes of flour to the port in Tripoli, an economy ministry official told news channel LBCI.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/aug\/08\/beirut-explosion-protests-lebanon-answers-and-justice","domain":"theguardian.com","published_date":"2020-08-08 10:45:00","title":"Beirut police fire teargas at protesters demanding justice over explosion","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/7ec0ceeba11fbde18e01129c5a62f3ba1c41230b\/0_199_3500_2100\/master\/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none","content":"Police in Beirut fired teargas and rubber bullets at thousands of people who had turned out to demand accountability for one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions the world has seen.

Hedwig Waltmans-Molier, 55, died on Saturday after being seriously injured by the explosion as she stood in her Beirut home, the Dutch foreign ministry said.\n\nFive days after the blast, the chances of finding anyone else alive under the rubble are fading, even though professional search and rescue teams have taken over the search for survivors.\n\nView image in fullscreen A map created using satellite data shows the extent of likely damage following the huge explosion in Beirut.

It was the latest development in the rapid unravelling of president Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s hold on power in Belarus during the past week, and potentially one of the most significant.\n\nBelarus One, the national channel, has been churning out government propaganda throughout Lukashenko\u2019s quarter-century rule, and at the beginning of last week was painting the protesters as dangerous provocateurs paid from abroad to disrupt the glorious stability brought by Lukashenko.\n\nBut Belarus has changed so quickly in the past week that many at the channel feel they can no longer work for the propaganda machine. On Monday, about 300 of the station\u2019s 2,000 employees went on strike, saying they would not return to work unless the government implemented five demands, including new elections and the removal of television censorship.\n\n\u201cPeople feel that if we can\u2019t do honest journalism, then we won\u2019t work,\u201d said the documentary maker Kseniya Lutskina, one of those who signed. She was standing outside the headquarters on Monday afternoon fielding calls from colleagues and trying to persuade them to sign up.\n\nLutskina said some of those striking had said they would come to the office but not work, and said that all but the most ideological were considering joining, but many were scared. \u201cThe problem for a lot of people is that the there\u2019s no other television to work at in the country \u2013 it\u2019s all state-controlled,\u201d she said. Management has threatened to fire those who go on strike.\n\nSome employees walked out even before the recent elections, feeling suffocated by the atmosphere as Lukashenko jailed his political opponents and looked set to rig the election. Alexander Luchonok, who worked for 18 months as a special correspondent on the twice-weekly current affairs programme Under the President\u2019s Control, handed in his resignation a week before the election.\n\nLuchonok said most correspondents at the station simply wanted to pursue a good career, but added that there were some ideologues who were genuine Lukashenko supporters. \u201cEven if they don\u2019t believe everything in the reports, they think it\u2019s important to keep Lukashenko in office,\u201d he said in a recent interview.\n\nSensitive political topics were ordered directly from the presidential administration, he said, but \u201cof course, mainly it\u2019s about self-censorship; you know what not to say\u201d.\n\nLuchonok was also deeply disturbed by the station\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus crisis, which Lukashenko dismissed as a \u201cpsychosis\u201d that should not stop people from working. \u201cI watched someone who went through a relative dying of coronavirus and saw this same person ordering people to produce a report on how the virus situation in the country was under control,\u201d he said.\n\nFor years, the television news has reported on the country as if it is still part of the Soviet Union in 1980: nightly spots on tractor production and grain harvests, always featuring the great leader keeping an eye on things and reprimanding wayward officials.\n\nEven as the country was plunged into chaos last week, there were attempts to portray business as usual. Last Tuesday, as riot police were chasing protesters through Minsk for a third consecutive night and thousands were being subjected to appalling conditions and violent treatment inside prisons, the evening news on Belarus One opened with news of Lukashenko chairing a cabinet meeting about the price of rapeseed oil.\n\n\u201cThe peasants are working better than ever before, and we have meat, salt and butter,\u201d he said, ahead of a package featuring footage of various factory production lines.\n\nThere was also time for sinister coverage of the protests. Video was carefully edited to make it look as if the majority of the violence had come from the protesters\u2019 side, and there were gruesome interviews with bloodied protesters, lying face down on the ground, hands tied behind their back, who croaked in pain that they would never protest again. Anchors repeatedly emphasised that the protests had been ordered from abroad with the goal of destabilising the country.\n\nMany older people get their news from television, and for this reason it has become one of the protesters\u2019 targets. On Saturday, and again on Monday, crowds gathered outside the headquarters.\n\n\u201cTell the truth to our grandparents,\u201d read a huge banner placed outside the entrance. Riot police inside the building formed a defence line to prevent the protesters from entering.\n\nAt the vast protest rally on Sunday, the opposition politician Maria Kolesnikova said she was appealing to journalists on state television, as well as security forces and diplomats, to join the protests. \u201cThis is your last chance. Fight your fear like all of us did. We were all scared, but we fought our fear. Join us and we will support you,\u201d she said."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.express.co.uk\/news\/world\/1322691\/paris-lockdown-france-paris-covid-red-zone-coronavirus-emmanuel-macron","domain":"express.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-14 06:06:00","title":"Paris lockdown: France designates capital 'coronavirus RED ZONE' as crisis erupts","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.images.express.co.uk\/img\/dynamic\/78\/590x\/paris-lockdown-1322691.jpg?r=1597406842541","content":"Paris: Police patrol streets to oversee face mask compliance\n\nThe French government has declared the city and the area around Marseille on the Mediterranean coast as \"red\" zones with a high coronavirus infection risk.

Fisher, an infectious diseases physician at Singapore\u2019s National University Hospital and chair of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, a group that monitors and reacts to dangerous epidemics.With countries from Australia to Spain struggling to arrest fresh waves of the contagion, scientists and public health officials are looking to additional tools, including sniffer dogs and drones, to hunt down the insidious virus.People can transmit the virus before they develop symptoms, frustrating efforts to stem transmission using the mainstay approach -- testing and isolating infected people and tracing their contacts -- alone. Resurgences have occurred in places that have gone months without recording a new infection, forcing governments to impose economically-crippling restrictions again and testing citizens\u2019 tolerance for the disruption wrought by the pandemic.The virus\u2019 stealthiness means it\u2019s crucial to find ways to augment traditional surveillance, said Peter Collignon, a professor of clinical medicine at the Australian National University Medical School in Canberra.Monitoring wastewater is a useful way to find the pathogen before it\u2019s identified within a community, said Collignon. Infected people don\u2019t just shed the virus in their respiratory droplets; it may also be in their urine and feces -- sometimes during the incubation period and even after nose and throat tests are no longer positive for the virus.\u201cA lot of data suggested it predates the increase in clinical cases,\u201d Collignon said in an interview.Finding the virus in wastewater can serve as an early warning system, and provide a trigger for authorities to start increasing restrictions on people and their movements, he said. \u201cBecause if we do it now, rather than waiting for 10 days, we\u2019ll probably see less of an outbreak.\u201d\u201cYou can use sewage testing to adjust the limits you put on the movement of populations over different periods of time.\u201d Collignon said.That sort of nuance may be useful as the pandemic -- now in its eighth month -- grinds on. Strict social distancing measures are proving harder to enforce in some places, particularly among young people and those who don\u2019t get paid if they\u2019re ill or self-isolating. Another mass lockdown in the Australian city of Melbourne has proved less effective the second time around with some defying the restrictions.Wuhan, the central Chinese city where Covid-19 first emerged in December, is routinely testing sewage and environmental samples from hospitals, markets and shopping malls. No traces of the virus have been found in wastewater since the data were made available in mid-June.In Singapore, an explosion in cases among migrant workers caught authorities off guard, triggering a pivot in its approach to the virus. The country started a a pilot program to monitor wastewater in April, focusing on the dormitories that accommodate the workers, infections among whom have pushed Singapore\u2019s case tally beyond 52,000. Testing of wastewater has since been expanded to include other population-dense centers such as hostels and residential care facilities.Other alternative surveillance methods that don\u2019t require people to front up for testing are also being deployed elsewhere.Separate teams in Germany, the U.K., France, Finland and Australia are training dogs to sniff out people with the coronavirus, counting on the animal\u2019s ultra-sensitive noses to detect metabolic changes in Covid-19 that the patients themselves may not notice.An international team aims to have dogs trained in months for \u201clow cost, instantaneous and reliable screening\u201d at airports, hospitals and quarantine sites, according to the University of Adelaide, in South Australia, which is helping to study the sensitivity and specificity of \u201ccanine olfactory detection\u201d of Covid-19 against standard lab tests.-In the same city, researchers at the University of South Australia are working on \u201cpandemic drones\u201d that have specialized sensor and computer vision systems to spot people with the telltale signs of a respiratory infection in crowds. They could be used in offices, airports, cruise ships, residential care facilities and other places where groups of people may work or congregate.In South Korea , widely lauded for its success in suppressing the pandemic with out disruptive measures like lockdowns, health officials in Seoul have relied on their version of Navy Seals -- elite teams of epidemiologists, laboratory technicians and database specialists -- to identify infected people early in order to curb spread.Authorities say they have compressed the time it takes to trace contacts with those infected from one day to 10 minutes, potentially limiting the scale of infections through speedy intervention. But their speedy response also relies on a wide range of data collected by mobile carriers, credit card issuers, the surveillance cameras that are ubiquitous in cities like Seoul and lately a QR code registering system installed at entertainment venues to pin down potential contacts.To be sure, most of these alternative methods aim to seek out vestiges of the virus in places where it isn\u2019t apparent, making their relevance where the illness is widespread, such as parts of the U.S. and some developing countries, questionable.Wastewater surveillance is a \u201cblunt tool\u201d that\u2019s not helpful in places where the virus is circulating widely, said Fisher at the National University Hospital . Researchers at Shanghai\u2019s Tongji University found the pathogen was harder to detect in sewage after toilets were cleaned with chlorine and other disinfectants.But as the world anxiously awaits the development of safe and effective vaccines, a combination of active monitoring and early intervention is the only sure way to gain control over the stealthy virus, according to Collignon at the Australian National University.\u201cThis is an essential public health measurement that needs to be done not only now but continuously, and the results need to be available for everybody to see within 24 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have to act on the results, not just assume it\u2019s a research project.\u201d"},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/news.sky.com\/story\/us-maintains-tariffs-in-eu-trade-fight-but-postpones-hikes-12048160","domain":"news.sky.com","published_date":"2020-08-13

We are here to protect our fauna and flora,\" said Ashok Subron, an environmental activist at Mahebourg, one of the worst-hit areas.\n\nPolice said they would execute a search warrant granted by a Mauritius court to board the Wakashio and seize items of interest, including the ship's log book and communication exchanges, as part of its investigation into the accident.\n\nThe ship's captain, a 58-year-old Indian national, will accompany officers on the search, police officials said.\n\nTwenty crew members evacuated safely from the Japanese-owned but Panamanian-flagged ship when it ran aground are under surveillance.\n\nPrime Minister Jugnauth thanked France for dispatching a naval vessel, military aircraft and technical experts from nearby Reunion, a French Indian Ocean island, to assist with the disaster.\n\nHe has convened an crisis committee later Sunday, and has expressed concern that forecast bad weather could further complicate efforts to stymie the spill, and cause more structural damage to the vessel.\n\nThe opposition has called for the resignation of the country's environment and fisheries ministers, as pressure mounts on the government to explain why more was not done to prepare in the two weeks since the ship ran aground.\n\nMitsui OSK Lines, which operates the vessel owned by another Japanese company, said efforts to place containment booms near the ship had been unsuccessful due to high waves. Helicopters had been shifting some of the 3,800 tonnes of fuel and 2,000 tonnes of diesel to land.\n\nAerial images show the enormous scale of the damage, with huge stretches of azure seas around the marooned cargo ship stained a deep inky black, and the region's fabled lagoons and inlets clouded over.\n\nThe Wakashio struck a reef at Pointe d'Esny, an ecological jewel fringed by idyllic beaches, colourful reefs, sanctuaries for rare and endemic wildlife, and unique RAMSAR-listed wetlands.\n\nMauritius and its 1.3 million inhabitants depend crucially on its seas for food and for ecotourism, and has fostered a reputation as a conservation success story and a world-class destination for nature lovers.\n\nEcologists fear if the ship further breaks it could inflict potentially catastrophic damage on the island nation's coastline, which forms the backbone of the economy."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/video\/2020\/aug\/04\/trump-says-us-should-take-share-of-proceeds-from-proposed-tiktok-sale-video","domain":"theguardian.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 02:11:13","title":"Trump says US should take share of proceeds from proposed TikTok sale \u2013 video","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/f6896645c0824d9ec4d855466ac77d60161b440c\/0_116_3500_2101\/master\/3500.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none","content":"Donald Trump says the Treasury should receive a share of proceeds from the proposed sale of Chinese-owned video app TikTok.

They froze its bank accounts and arrested key staff members.\n\nApple Daily announced it was closing on Wednesday afternoon, signalling both the end of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy paper and a broader journalistic era.\n\n\"Apple Daily really was a key institution of Hong Kong society,\" Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said. \"It was something people grew up with, [it was] part of our daily lives.\n\n\"There are other outlets, but no one was quite as big and vocal as Apple Daily. That's why the government was so annoyed with them. But they refused to back down - they stayed true to themselves.\"\n\nForbidden fruit\n\nApple Daily was established in 1995 by Lai, and was reportedly named after the forbidden fruit in the Bible. \"If Eve hadn't bitten the forbidden fruit, there would be no sin, no right and wrong, and of course - no news,\" Lai told the Lianhe Evening News.\n\nThe paper soon established itself as a tabloid and became known for its sensationalist articles and bold headlines. Its early coverage centred on crime and entertainment news, and occasionally strayed into unethical territory.\n\nGetty Images Jimmy Lai at the Apple Daily offices in 1995\n\nBut over the years the paper evolved and started to cover more politics. Hong Kong began experiencing a series of social movements in the early 2000s which saw people resisting integration with mainland China.\n\nDr Joyce Nip, a senior lecturer in Chinese media studies at the University of Sydney, told me this growing resistance opened up the market of political news for Apple Daily. She also said it gave the paper a unique advantage when other mainstream news outlets began \"toeing the line of one country [one system]\".\n\n\"Apple Daily generally disapproves of the Beijing political system, mainland China and its appointed administration in Hong Kong, both in its news agenda and in its [framing] of the news,\" said Dr Nip.\n\nAnd while the paper continued to cover soft news and entertainment, it produced a growing number of political pieces and cemented its position as an unapologetically pro-democracy outlet.\n\nIts reporters are typically barred from covering news in mainland China, and none were permitted to cover the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. The paper's criticism of the Chinese government and pro-establishment figures in Hong Kong also resulted in frequent advertising boycotts.\n\nThe beginning of the end\n\nIn June last year, Beijing implemented a sweeping new security law - despite much criticism and protest.\n\nThe law gives Beijing powers to shape life in Hong Kong it has never had before. Critics say it effectively curtails protest and freedom of speech, though China has said it will return stability.\n\nJust months after the law was implemented, Lai and a handful of other media figures and activists were arrested and the Apple Daily officers were raided.\n\nBut the paper did not back down. If anything, it doubled down - accusing the police of \"blatantly bypass[ing] the law and abusing their power\".\n\nGetty Images Around 200 police officers raided the paper's office\n\nFor a while it seemed as though the paper would continue - even as its founder faced an increasingly long string of charges and was then sentenced to 20 months in prison.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC before he was jailed, Lai said he would not give in to intimidation.\"If they can induce fear in you, that's the cheapest way to control you and the most effective way and they know it,\" he said.\n\n\"The only way to defeat the way of intimidation is to face up to fear and don't let it frighten you.\"\n\nJimmy Lai in 2021: The Hong Kong billionaire becomes emotional as he faces prison\n\nBut on 17 June - just days before the paper's 26th anniversary - history repeated itself.\n\nHundreds of police officers raided the paper's headquarters and this time, they froze HK$18m ($2.3m; \u00a31.64m) of its assets over allegations that its reports breached the national security law.\n\nPolice also detained its chief editor and four other executives. The freezing of company accounts meant the paper no longer had money to pay its staff and run daily operations.\n\nGetty Images Chief Operations Officer Chow Tat Kuen (C) was escorted by police from the paper's headquarters\n\n\"The government basically forced them to end themselves. They hadn't even been found guilty but their assets were frozen. They had money but they just couldn't touch it,\" said Prof Tsui.\n\n\"It was a public display of power, saying loud and clear who is in charge and declaring what is unacceptable behaviour,\" Dr Nip said.\n\nThe announcement of its closure on Wednesday followed a tumultuous board meeting that saw one of its journalists arrested.\n\nMark Simon, an adviser to Lai, told the BBC the meeting was meant to \"decide the fate\" of Apple Daily. The police disruption he says, was meant to \"influence the outcome of this... they wanted to make sure it closed quickly\".\n\n\"Jimmy, he knew all along [the closure] was going to happen. It was no secret. We all knew it was coming but they [carried on] because that's what brave journalists do. I think the future of journalism in Hong Kong will be a battle... journalists will have to fight every day.\"\n\nGetty Images Apple Daily journalists hold freshly-printed copies of the newspaper's last edition\n\nOn Wednesday night, hundreds turned up outside the Apple Daily headquarters in the rain to say their farewells, shining mobile phone lights and shouting messages of encouragement.\n\nJournalists inside the building, who were putting together the paper's last edition, would occasionally come out onto a balcony and wave. Some one million copies were printed for the paper's final edition.\n\nIts sister paper Apple Daily Taiwan, which is a financially independent subsidiary of parent company Next Digital, will continue to run out of Taipei.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nSo what does the closure of one of the city's loudest pro-democracy voices signal for press freedom in the city? Professor Keith Richburg, director of journalism at the University of Hong Kong, believes it is impossible to know the full implications of Apple Daily's closure.\n\n\"We really cannot know if it presages a broader attack on the media in general,\" he said. \"We need to see whether the government and police are targeting Apple Daily alone, or signalling to the media more broadly that critical coverage will no longer be tolerated.\"\n\nOthers, however, are more optimistic.\n\n\"There are still lots of good journalists doing good journalism in Hong Kong, so I wouldn't say this is the end of press freedom,\" Prof Tsui said. \"It's more dangerous now to be a journalist - the stakes are a lot higher, but it is not impossible.\"\n\nGetty Images Apple Daily editions making their way out last week\n\nEarlier this week, Apple Daily broadcast the last ever episode of its live news show and shared a final message to its viewers."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2020\/aug\/12\/people-under-40-account-for-55-of-victorias-covid-cases-but-only-6-of-deaths","domain":"theguardian.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 03:44:00","title":"People under 40 account for 55% of Victoria's Covid cases but only 6% of deaths","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/755dd171a6f4b44dee0c6cac447d4e54cc17a140\/0_351_5300_3182\/master\/5300.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none","content":"More than half of Victoria\u2019s active cases of Covid-19 are in people aged 39 years old and younger, while less than 4% of the state\u2019s deaths have been in the same age group, data from the Department of Health shows.\n\nThe data included all cases of the virus and deaths up to 11 August. The age group with the highest amount of active cases is 20-29 years, with 1,823 infections. There have been no deaths in the state in this age group. Two deaths have occurred in those aged 30-39, while one death occurred in the 40-49 age group. Those aged between 0 and 39 comprise 54.9% of all active cases.\n\nMeanwhile, 103 people in their 80s and 47 people in their 70s have died. On Wednesday the premier, Daniel Andrews, said of the 21 deaths overnight \u2013 the state\u2019s deadliest 24 hours to date \u2013 11 were aged in their 80s.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s Covid-19 infection control expert group chair, Professor Lyn Gilbert, said there were numerous reasons behind the significant numbers of young people with the virus. Before the restrictions and lockdown took effect, she said, \u201cthey were less likely to stay home, more likely to gather in large groups, and less likely to heed physical-distancing advice\u201d.\n\nShe added that large families with shared child-minding arrangements had led to spread among children and teenagers. Their parents sometimes worked across multiple jobs in high-risk occupations, she added, with parents then infecting children and extended family.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the risk of infection is related to age, but to risk of exposure,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nThe Victorian government has just released data on Covid-19 cases by age group: pic.twitter.com\/RZU1jFRZVG \u2014 Melissa Davey (@MelissaLDavey) August 11, 2020\n\nInfectious disease doctor and epidemiologist Professor Allen Cheng said young people often had no or very mild symptoms. This meant their cases were not always being detected. He urged young people to get a test with even the mildest of symptoms, and to stay home until they received their result. \u201cThere are a lot of cases in this younger age group, and that reinforces the need to communicate better with this group who usually have milder symptoms,\u201d Cheng said.\n\nDr Ian Musgrave, a molecular pharmacologist and toxicologist with the University of Adelaide, agreed a higher level of asymptomatic spreaders in the younger age groups, who may then spread the virus to peers and siblings, needed to be factored in.\n\n\u201cI suspect the answer to why so many young people have the virus is complex,\u201d Musgrave said. \u201cYoung people are involved in more service jobs where they are exposed to more contact,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that young people aged 18 to 25 are not more susceptible to infection. This is in stark contrast to mortality, where mortality is strongly skewed to older age groups.\u201d\n\nHe added that younger age groups were likely to have been isolating less prior to lockdown, which he said was \u201cdue in part to the widespread belief that young people don\u2019t get Covid-19 as easily, and partly because the messaging is not reaching them\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday an article in the Medical Journal of Australia by Dr Zoe Hyde, from the University of Western Australia, cast doubt on the idea that children are much less susceptible to Covid-19 infection than adults and do not play a substantial role in transmission.\n\n\u201cHowever, emerging research suggests this perception is unfounded,\u201d Hyde wrote. While it was true children overall experienced much less severe illness from the virus, Hyde said \u201cthe role that children play in transmission is less certain, but there is no reason to think that children are less likely to transmit the virus than adults\u201d.\n\nIt meant when cases were identified in school communities, they must immediately close, as was the case in Victoria before schools moved to remote learning.\n\n\u201cSchools are clearly neither inherently safe nor unsafe,\u201d the article said. \u201cThe risk associated with these settings depends on the level of community transmission, and it must be continuously evaluated. Schools must not remain open for face-to-face teaching in the setting of ongoing community transmission.\u201d"},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.news18.com\/news\/india\/aimplb-removes-controversial-tweet-comparing-hagia-sophia-to-babri-masjid-after-backlash-2765799.html","domain":"news18.com","published_date":"2020-08-07 05:56:58","title":"AIMPLB Removes Controversial Tweet Comparing Hagia Sophia to Babri Masjid After Backlash","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.news18.com\/ibnlive\/uploads\/2021\/07\/1627283897_news18_logo-1200x800.jpg","content":"After backlash from its own community members, including senior member of the board and prominent lawyer Zafaryab Jilani, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Thursday deleted its controversial tweet comparing Hagia Sophia in Turkey to the Babri Masjid.\n\nHowever, the board posted another tweet on the issue with exclusion of its earlier comparison.\n\nThe AIMPLB had on Tuesday said that Babri Masjid was and would always be a mosque.

This year, a teacher living in United Arab Emirates (UAE) has created a beautiful portrait of Mahatma Gandhi using thousands of buttons to pay tribute to the Father of the Nation.\n\nRashida Adil, head of the department for art and craft at the Sharjah Indian School (boys) in Juwaiza, decided to re-purpose nearly 5,000 tiny buttons, in various sizes and colours, to create the masterpiece .\n\nThe unique artwork was then gifted to Dr Aman Puri, the Consul General of India, Dubai before the Independence Day celebrations started at the consulate. Dressed in a white salwar suit and a tri-colour dupatta, the teacher, who has been living in the country for over two decades, handed over the gift for Consulate General of India in Dubai.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTalking to IndianExpress.com, Adil said that the intricate artwork was indeed taxing but a befitting tribute to Mahatma Gandhi. \u201cThe most difficult task was to keep the buttons in place. Owing to summers, I had to re-attach the buttons many times, sometimes even after framing it, I have had to open it up a few times.

The measure, to take effect on Wednesday will also concern sports facilities and social clubs, said Fearne, who is also deputy prime minister. Mass gatherings in public have been restricted to 15 people, while restaurants and shops have been allowed to remain open. Health superintendent Charmaine Gauci said the new \u201cmore controlling\u201d measures are aimed at ensuring social distancing. Coronavirus cases have been rising steadily in Malta, seen some months ago as a European success story for its handling of the pandemic. It currently counts 607 active cases of Covid-19 - almost double the peaks it saw in March and April. The surge, which began nearly a month ago, has been traced to a weekend-long party at a hotel and a traditional village religious feast. Malta has recorded a total of 1,375 infections since 7 March, when the first case was detected. Of those, 759 have recovered and nine have died. Two people are currently receiving treatment in intensive care. Meanwhile, Fearne also announced that Malta will introduce a new \u201camber travel list\u201d of countries whose nationals must present a certificate showing a negative Covid-19 swab test from the previous 72 hours before being allowed entry.

At least 300 people queued outside the Asia Pacific mall, which specialises in selling Chinese-made products, ahead of opening hours and rushed inside as private security guards attempted to dispense alcohol gel and take temperatures, in some cases resulting in physical clashes with shoppers. The mall is situated in the capital\u2019s Central Station, where a strict lockdown over the past three months was eased on Monday morning. Like many Latin nations, Chile has a large population of informal vendors who struggled after movement restrictions reduced their customer base. The reopening of Central Station, along with the adjoining Central Santiago which hosts government offices and business headquarters, passed off largely uneventfully, albeit with larger concentrations of people in reopened shops and on public transport. Around 12 of the Asia Pacific mall\u2019s 70 shops reopened, according to the municipality. Felipe Alessandri, the Santiago mayor, said some stores had offered \u201cirresistible\u201d sales that had attracted shoppers from across the capital\u2019s province. He warned that short-term thinking would see the quarantine reinstated. He told journalists outside the mall as the authorities arrived to close it down: There is now greater freedom, and more responsibility needed, but clearly human stupidity knows no bounds. Isabel Zuniga, the owner of one of stores that reopened, said she had sought to implement an appointment booking system for customers on Facebook, but had been overwhelmed by crowds. It\u2019s understandable because these people are street vendors who haven\u2019t worked for three of four months. They don\u2019t get government support, and they are desperate to restore their businesses and feed their families.

It added that tests were carried out after unusually large numbers of mink died at the farms. The animal, which is bred for its fur, is known to be susceptible to Sars-CoV-2, the agency said, after mink carrying the virus were found on four of the 155 farms in the Netherlands. Two cats in New York became the first pets in the United States in April to have contracted the coronavirus, although there is no evidence of pets spreading the virus to humans. The USDA said there was currently no evidence that animals, including mink, play a significant role in spreading the virus to human.

New case figures published on Mondays have consistently been lower than weekend tallies since the start of the outbreak as fewer coronavirus tests are conducted on Sundays, so the dip in infections does not necessarily signal a change of trend. The seven-day moving average of new infections, which smoothes out reporting irregularities, stood at 2,322, above the 2,000 threshold for the fourth day in a row \u2013 a sequence unseen since 20 April, when France was in the midst of one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus. France\u2019s cumulative total of infections has reached 219,029. With infections increasing anew, French authorities are scrambling to avoid a second, economically damaging nationwide lockdown. The government is set to propose on Tuesday that masks be worn in shared indoor workspaces while Paris and Marseille, France\u2019s two biggest cities again declared \u201cred zones\u201d of infection, have expanded areas where mask-wearing is mandatory. Since the beginning of August, Covid-19 cases have increased by 1,830 on an average daily basis, a figure two-and-a-half times higher than July\u2019s average, and also higher than the 1,678 figure in March, when the spread of the virus was accelerating. After consistent declines since a 14 April peak of 32,292, the number of people hospitalised for the disease rose by 65 to 4,925, after a rise of 3 on Sunday and 29 on Saturday. And the number of people treated in intensive care units (ICU) has increased by 17 over the last three days to 384. That ICU figure reached a peak of 7,148 on 8 April, when the French health system was on the brink of breakdown.

Bush and was a Republican voice against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has died, a Bush spokesperson said Friday. He was 95.\n\nScowcroft died Thursday of natural causes at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, spokesperson Jim McGrath said.\n\nScowcroft was the only person to serve as national security adviser to two different administrations. His appointment by Ford in 1975 came as Scowcroft retired from the Air Force with the rank of lieutenant general. He advised Bush, by then a close friend, during the four years of the Bush administration, 1989-93.\n\nIn a study of Scowcroft\u2019s career, historian David F. Schmitz noted that Scowcroft had been at the center of numerous post-Vietnam War discussions of American foreign policy. He was part of the presidential administrations that grappled with U.S. responses to the collapse of communism in Europe, the crackdown in China after the Tiananmen Square protests, and Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Gulf War.\n\n\u201cThe key tenets of his thinking, shaped by the Second World War, were that national security policy had to protect the nation from aggression, provide international stability, control arms while maintaining preparedness, and shape an international environment that was conducive to America\u2019s goals and needs,\u201d Schmitz wrote.\n\nDescribed as both gentle and tough, a brilliant coordinator most concerned with results, a tireless worker used to 18-hour days, Scowcroft offered a self-assessment to The Washington Post on the eve of the George H.W. Bush administration: \u201cI don\u2019t have a quick, innovative mind. I don\u2019t automatically think of good, new ideas. What I do better is pick out good ideas from bad ideas. ... It is comforting to be doing things that make a difference. In the end, it\u2019s the job that\u2019s more important.\u201d\n\nScowcroft was born March 19, 1925, in Ogden, Utah, where his father owned a wholesale grocery business. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1947 and then joined the Army Air Corps, which soon became the Air Force. Only a few months after completing pilot training, he broke his back in the crash of an F-51, which put him in the hospital for two years.\n\nRefocusing his military career on strategy and planning, Scowcroft earned a master\u2019s degree at Columbia University in 1953 and then taught Russian history at West Point. In 1957, he began studying at the Strategic Intelligence School in Washington. Two years later, he was an assistant air attach\u00e9 in the American Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, then taught political science at the U.S. Air Force Academy.\n\nScowcroft was assigned to Air Force headquarters and the Defense Department during the 1960s and earned a doctorate in international relations from Columbia in 1967. He was appointed military assistant to President Richard Nixon in 1972. A year later he became deputy assistant for national security under Henry Kissinger, Nixon\u2019s national security adviser.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter leaving the White House with the election of Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1976, Scowcroft set up a consulting firm serving international businesses and eventually joined Kissinger in creating Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm with similar goals.\n\nScowcroft served on Carter\u2019s advisory committee on arms control and was chairman of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Commission on Strategic Forces, which focused on the effort to modernize U.S. nuclear weapons. He also served on the three-member Tower Commission, which investigated the arms-for-hostages affair that occurred during the Reagan administration.\n\nScowcroft had been a close friend of George H.W. Bush since they had served together in the Nixon administration. With Bush\u2019s election in 1988, Scowcroft was interested in leading the Pentagon as defense secretary during the Bush administration. He accepted a return engagement as national security adviser when he realized he would be at the president\u2019s side instead of running the massive bureaucracy at the Defense Department.\n\nAfter Bush lost his reelection bid to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992, Scowcroft returned to consulting. He co-wrote with Bush a book about the Cold War, \u201cA World Transformed,\u201d published in 1998, and with Carter national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski the book \u201cAmerica and the World: Conversations on the Future of American Foreign Policy\u201d in 2008.\n\nIn 2002, Scowcroft angered the White House of his friend\u2019s son, President George W. Bush, when he publicly expressed the view that little evidence tied Saddam Hussein to terrorist organizations and warned that war with Iraq could damage if not destroy U.S. alliances in the region.\n\nIn a column for The Wall Street Journal, Scowcroft wrote: \u201cThe central point is that any campaign against Iraq, whatever the strategy, cost and risks, is certain to divert us for some indefinite period from our war on terrorism. Worse, there is a virtual consensus in the world against an attack on Iraq at this time. So long as that sentiment persists, it would require the U.S. to pursue a virtual go-it-alone strategy against Iraq, making any military operations correspondingly more difficult and expensive.\u201d\n\nGiven his relationship with the Bush family, Scowcroft\u2019s criticism of the administration carried particular weight. \u201cI thought they were rushing to judgment and making a serious mistake,\u201d Scowcroft recalled during an interview with the West Point Center for Oral History. His concerns, made privately before he spoke out publicly, were \u201cpretty much rejected\u201d by the younger Bush\u2019s White House, he said.\n\nPresident George W. Bush and his wife, Laura, said in a statement Friday that they were saddened to learn of Scowcroft's death.\n\n\u201cThis patriot had a long career of distinguished service to our country. As a retired Air Force general, he gave sound and thoughtful advice to several presidents.

Any major setback in Russia could damage confidence in vaccines.\n\nThe stakes are high in the bid to end a crisis that\u2019s killed more than 750,000 people worldwide. The Trump administration is pushing ahead with Operation Warp Speed, an unprecedented U.S. effort to accelerate Covid vaccine development and manufacturing, and a massive mobilization is underway in China to get immunizations across the line. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Aug. 11 announcement on Russia\u2019s shot adds a new twist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAny move to roll out the vaccine based on limited evidence that it works could have harmful consequences, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an infectious disease specialist at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cThat could cause other leaders to say: \u2018Look, they\u2019re doing it, and that\u2019s good enough. And if that\u2019s good enough for them, we don\u2019t want to lose out. We want to protect our populations too,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nHistory offers lessons on the importance of a rigorous approach to vaccine development, insulated from politics. Misperceptions about the safety of well established immunizations are already widespread; actual stumbles that have occurred in the field \u2014 although rare \u2014 only add to fears, and show how a botched Covid shot could further distort and inflame public opinion.\n\nAccelerated Plans\n\nRussian officials have dismissed concerns about safety and the pace at which the country is moving. Western jealousy, they say, is fueling criticism of the vaccine, dubbed Sputnik V in a nod to the Soviet Union\u2019s launch of the world\u2019s first satellite sent into space in 1957. Putin said one of his daughters has already been given the shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAuthorities said they plan to start inoculating medical workers and other risk groups by the end of the month, introducing it to volunteers who will be closely monitored, and they add that other countries are moving swiftly too. Russia last month began clinical trials for a second vaccine, developed by the Vector laboratory in Novosibirsk.\n\nMeanwhile, developers including Britain\u2019s AstraZeneca Plc \u2014 the University of Oxford\u2019s partner \u2014 and U.S. biotech company Moderna Inc. are still in final-stage trials involving tens of thousands of people. Although President Donald Trump has said a vaccine may be ready by election day on Nov. 3, Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said it may take until well into 2021 for shots to reach much of the public.\n\nPoliticians aren\u2019t just seeking a vaccine to escape the pandemic. Some could use Covid-19 shots to try to burnish their leadership credentials and bury criticism of past performance.\n\nFor Prime Minister Boris Johnson, it\u2019s a chance to show that a Brexit-unchained U.K. can independently develop vaccines faster than the European Union. A Chinese vaccine might help Xi Jinping erase the memory of the virus\u2019s origin. Trump needs a surprise to turn the polls as the U.S. leads the world in deaths. And Putin has an opportunity to beat the West and gain a strategic advantage. His performance ratings have slumped as Russia\u2019s Covid case tally has risen to the fourth-highest globally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe needs a big win,\u201d said Stephen Morrison, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 Global Health Policy Center. \u201cHis economy is flat on its back with Covid and the collapse on the oil markets.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Shot\n\nFor those reasons, Putin may not be swayed by concerns about any potential adverse impact from the vaccine. China has already begun using its shot in the military, and those people are unlikely to be able to give informed, voluntary consent, according to Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University professor of global health law.\n\nThat may embolden other political leaders to take similar steps to bypass regulators like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Trump is already in some ways behind in a race where the U.S.\u2019s two major geopolitical rivals have used their authoritarian might to sprint ahead. FDA officials have emphasized that they will clear a Covid vaccine only after careful analysis, basing decisions on \u201cgood science and data.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Trump will try to influence the FDA and it will bend but won\u2019t break,\u201d Gostin said. \u201cI have confidence in the FDA, but I\u2019m very worried. I have no doubt that we could go the path of China or Russia if we didn\u2019t have strong institutional guardrails.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven if he sought to move unilaterally on vaccine authorization, Trump may have boxed himself in with Warp Speed, Morrison said. The government has committed billions of dollars to companies to develop vaccines, and they\u2019re unlikely to cooperate with a plan to distribute unproven products without testing that shows their safety, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be much more difficult for Trump to pull off a stunt like this than Putin,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nProduction Deals\n\nThe Russian candidate is being developed by Moscow\u2019s Gamaleya Institute, the Defense Ministry and the sovereign Russian Direct Investment Fund, who say the vaccine is undergoing the last phase of trials. The World Health Organization lists it as still in the earliest stage.\n\nMass production is lined up in India, South Korea, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Cuba, with at least 20 countries interested in obtaining supplies, the fund said. Russia\u2019s vaccine could help the global economy recover, according to Kirill Dmitriev, its chief executive officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe countries which quickly gain access to a safe vaccine will make it through the crisis successfully, fearlessly, and with minimal losses,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the virus spreads, there\u2019s a risk countries reliant on bigger economies for supplies could end up accepting a product that hasn\u2019t proved itself, said Offit, the University of Pennsylvania expert. Another concern is the impact to the global effort to fight a range of diseases if a fast-moving Russian vaccine runs into problems.\n\nSkeptics would inevitably point to that and other cases from the past.\n\nIn 2016, the Philippines started a major drive to vaccinate children against dengue. But it was suspended after the shot, Dengvaxia, was linked to an increased risk of severe disease in some who hadn\u2019t previously been exposed to the mosquito-borne virus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwine Flu\n\nAfter a 1976 outbreak of swine flu in the U.S. stoked fears of a global crisis, then-President Gerald Ford announced a plan to vaccinate everyone in the country. Soon more than 40 million Americans had received shots. But it never turned into a pandemic, and some of those who had been vaccinated developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis.\n\nAny missteps with a Covid inoculation developed too quickly could impact trust in a safer product that comes later, according to Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project and a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.\n\n\u201cWe have one chance to make a first impression,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Russia\u2019s short-cuts in the rush for a vaccine lead to an unnecessary adverse event, it may erode already fragile confidence.\u201d"},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2020\/aug\/12\/a-poor-vaccine-is-worse-than-no-vaccine-the-challenges-faced-by-scientists","domain":"theguardian.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 12:04:00","title":"'They've jumped the gun': scientists worry about Russia's Covid-19 vaccine","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.guim.co.uk\/img\/media\/8ea57ac2dd44c1bb4b31969d3890569dc0e2f5d3\/0_196_5289_3174\/master\/5289.jpg?width=465&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none","content":"In 1977, Scott Halstead, a virologist at the University of Hawaii, was studying dengue fever when he noticed a now well-known but then unexpected feature of the disease.\n\nAnimals that had already been exposed to one of the four closely related viruses that cause dengue and produced antibodies to it, far from being protected against other versions, became sicker when infected a second time, and it was the antibodies produced by the first infection that were responsible, allowing the second infection to hitchhike into the body.\n\nThe effect was called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The reason it matters today, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, is that unexpected glitches such as ADE are the kind of problems vaccine developers look for in phase-3 testing of vaccines \u2013 testing that has yet to be carried out on Russia\u2019s newly approved Sputnik V vaccine.\n\nIn recent weeks, as announcements on the development of scores of vaccines around the world have come in rapid succession, the still poorly understood mechanisms of ADE have been thrust into the spotlight as scientists speculate on whether vaccine-produced antibodies could trigger this effect.\n\nADE \u201cis a genuine concern\u201d, Kevin Gilligan, a virologist and senior consultant with Biologics Consulting, told Nature Biotechnology in June. \u201cBecause if the gun is jumped and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease-enhancing, that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all.\u201d\n\nThis week, following Russia\u2019s announcement that it is pushing ahead with mass production of Sputnik V and mass inoculation , the fears expressed by the likes of Gilligan became a chorus, underlining the concerns among scientists that Russian researchers have jumped the gun.\n\n1:16 Russia approves Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine despite testing safety concerns \u2013 video\n\nRussia has described claims that the vaccine is unsafe as groundless, and on Wednesday vowed to roll it out in two weeks. But criticism has continued to build.\n\nAmong those mentioning ADE as a concern was Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College. He said part of the problem was that the work behind Russia\u2019s vaccine development had been so opaque that no one really knows how safe or even how effective it will be.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the Russian researchers have done anything wrong, but I think they\u2019ve jumped the gun,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cIf we are talking about safety then you have to be looking at issues like ADE, which was a concern that scuppered some efforts to develop a Sars vaccine, where it exacerbated an asthma-like response in lungs.\u201d\n\nIt is not just the potential for issues such as ADE that concerns people like Altmann, who is optimistic that the hunt for a vaccine for Covid-19 is not \u201cintractable\u201d. He said the ideal approach would have been to compare 150 or so different vaccine candidates transparently, using the same testing criteria, to ensure the world gets the best vaccine, not simply the first.\n\n\u201cNo two of these candidates is going be alike in terms of safety, how effective they are or how cheap they are to produce,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re crying out for transparency and peer review is because those factors are very serious. There have been too many debacles in this pandemic. This is not another occasion to blunder in. You want to line up the candidates side by side.\u201d\n\nThe lack of effective testing throws up other issues. \u201cI think there is enough general background data \u2026 to assume the [Russian] vaccine itself will be safe at the usual doses,\u201d Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading, said in a statement posted on the Science Media Centre website. \u201cThe bigger risk, however, is that the immunity generated is not sufficient to give protection, leading to continued virus spread even among immunised individuals.\n\n\u201cAnd although only a possibility, less than complete protection could provide a selection pressure that drives the virus to evade what antibody there is, creating strains that then evade all vaccine responses. In that sense, a poor vaccine is worse than no vaccine. Careful virus tracking will therefore need to accompany any early release.\u201d\n\nEven before Russia\u2019s announcement, some were warning about accelerated vaccine development programmes in Russia and in the US. In an opinion piece for the New York Times, Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, flagged up many of the same issues, adding that she would hesitate to take a vaccine that appeared to have been rushed through without proper testing.\n\n\u201c[The] benchmark [of phase-3 testing] is crucial because a weak vaccine might be worse than no vaccine at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not want people who are only slightly protected to behave as if they are invulnerable, which could exacerbate transmission. It is also costly to roll out a vaccine, diverting attention away from other efforts that we know work, like mask-wearing, and from testing better vaccines.\u201d\n\nThe last thing phase-3 trials do is examine safety. Earlier trials do this too, but larger trials allow for rarer side effects to be detected. One such effect is a paradoxical phenomenon known as immune enhancement, in which a vaccinated person\u2019s immune system overreacts to infection. Researchers can test for this by comparing the rates of disease severe enough to require hospitalisation across two groups.\n\n\u201cA clear signal that hospitalisation is higher among vaccinated participants would mark the end of a vaccine,\u201d Dean said."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.peacefmonline.com\/pages\/local\/social\/202008\/423779.php","domain":"peacefmonline.com","published_date":"2020-08-16 15:54:06","title":"Suspected Serial Killer Escapes From Police Custody | Social","lang":"en","large_image_url":"http:\/\/targetinfinity.com\/as\/www\/delivery\/avw.php?zoneid=124&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&n=a2f5e77e","content":"NIGERIA: The Oyo State Police Command has announced the escape of the prime suspect in connection with the serial ritual killings of over five persons in Akinyele, Moniya in Ibadan.

Lunsmann said he has attended the Sturgis event every year since 2003 and didn't want to miss the 80th, despite being \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned about the coronavirus.\n\nStill, the crowds of people and rows of bikes surprised him. He said there was no difference from previous years \u201cother than a few people wearing masks.\u201d\n\nLunsmann said he was avoiding the bars and nightclubs that line the city's main drag this year, but many others were not.

The death toll due to COVID-19 climbed to 47,033 with 942 people succumbing to the disease in the last 24 hours, health ministry data updated at 8 am showed. The case fatality rate in the country has declined to 1.96 per cent. There are 6,53,622 active COVID-19 cases in the country presently, which accounts for 27.27 per cent of its total caseload. India crossed the 20-lakh mark in terms of COVID-19 cases on August 7.\n\nThe much-awaited pilgrimage to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Cave Shrine may not resume even after August 16 when the government has issued guidelines for reopening of all the religious places as around 11 people have been tested positive at Bhawan in Trikuta Hills of Reasi district. \u201cIn total 11 people have been tested positive for COVID-19 at Bhawan,\u201d official sources here said. They said that three people tested positive on Tuesday and eight, including some of the priests, tested positive on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the Covid-19 pandemic not only threatens gains in fighting global poverty and building peace but risks exacerbating existing conflicts and generating new ones. The UN chief told a Security Council meeting on the challenge of sustaining peace during the pandemic that his March 23 call for an immediate cease-fire in conflicts around the world to tackle the coronavirus led a number of warring parties to take steps to de-escalate and stop fighting. \u201cYet, regrettably, in many instances, the pandemic did not move the parties to suspend hostilities or agree to a permanent ceasefire,\u201d Guterres said. His predecessor as secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, told the council: \u201cIt is truly astonishing that in response to this pandemic, the world has placed billions of people under lock-down, closed international borders, suspended trade and migration, and temporarily shut down a whole variety of industries but has not managed to suspend armed conflicts.\u201d\n\nBan criticised the UN Security Council for wasting valuable months \u201cin arguments over the details of the text\u201d and not adopting a resolution until July 1 demanding an \u201cimmediate cessation of hostilities\u201d in key conflicts including Syria, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan and Congo to tackle COVID-19. \u201cThis has weakened the message that this council needs to send to all warring parties: now is the time to confront our common enemy,\u201d Ban said. And he said delayed council action \u201cfurther aggravated the current volatile global security situations\u201d. \u201cThe impact of COVID-19 on conflict-affected settings has been much worse than initially thought,\u201d said Ban, who is a co-chair of the group of prominent world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela known as The Elders.\n\nThe British government has changed the way it compiles coronavirus deaths, a move that reduced the country\u2019s official death toll by more than 5,000. The Department of Health said the new total is 41,329, down from 46,706. That is still Europe\u2019s highest death toll. The government announced last month that it was reviewing the way death statistics were compiled, after academics pointed out that in England the tally included anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 and later died, with no cut-off point between positive test and death. That means some people recorded as coronavirus deaths may have died of other causes \u2013 and the proportion would increase over time.\n\nThat could explain why England has been showing far higher daily death tolls than Scotland, which only counts deaths that occur within 28 days of a positive test. Public Health England said Wednesday that it will also adopt a 28-day cut-off date, bringing it into line with the rest of the U.K. People who die more than 28 days after testing positive, but fewer than 60 days, will be added to the total only if COVID-19 appears on their death certificate. Public Health England said it made the change after discovering that \u201cin recent weeks the numbers of deaths in people who have tested positive have become substantially greater than the numbers of deaths subsequently registered as COVID-19 deaths\u201d by the Office for National Statistics, which uses death certificates to keep its tally.\n\nRead all the Latest India News here"},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/trump-claims-lockdowns-do-not-prevent-infection-future-undermines-fauci-2020-8","domain":"businessinsider.com","published_date":"2020-08-04 00:48:39","title":"Trump claims lockdowns 'do not prevent infection in the future,' undermines Fauci","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/i.insider.com\/5f28964540c1f3203c3a00a6?width=700","content":"President Donald Trump on Monday claimed that the lockdowns implemented during the coronavirus pandemic haven't reduced future infections and \"inflict more harm\" than they prevent.\n\n\"Lockdowns do not prevent infection in the future \u2014 they just don't.

Experts say these states include Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee.\n\n\"You may need to pause, you may need to drop back a little bit. I don't think you necessarily have to revert to go all the way back to reclosing,\" Fauci told JAMA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFauci emphasized that it's of utmost importance to contain the virus before the fall when the influenza season begins.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, another top public health expert advising the federal government, said on Sunday that the coronavirus pandemic had entered a \"new phase\" and reached an \"extraordinarily widespread\" community spread in both urban and rural areas.\n\nTrump has undermined and publicly disagreed with Fauci on a number of issues related to the pandemic response. While the president has aggressively downplayed the threat the virus poses to Americans and resisted various efforts to mitigate the spread, he's accused Fauci of being an \"alarmist\" and calling for overly-extreme measures to fight COVID-19.\n\nOn Monday, Trump called Birx \"pathetic\" after she issued her stark warning about community spread."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/news\/2020\/08\/kamala-harris-influenced-indian-jamaican-heritage-200812170300624.html","domain":"aljazeera.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 19:37:00","title":"Kamala Harris is influenced by her Indian and Jamaican heritage","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/7e861a22cb1c46eba3a40d7feaa53fb2_18.jpeg?resize=770%2C513&quality=80","content":"\u2018Historic day for Indian community\u2019, Harris\u2019s uncle cheers from India as US Democrats make appeal to people of colour.\n\nKamala Harris is not just the first Black woman to be selected as a vice-presidential candidate in the United States.\n\nA child of immigrants, Harris is the first woman of Indian and Jamaican descent to reach a position in US politics that has long been reserved for whites only.\n\nPresumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is betting that, on balance, Harris will have broad appeal with Black women and other voters of colour and serve as an anchor for the Democratic Party \u2013 all while boosting turnout among white liberals and pulling support from independents and Republican-leaning white voters who have soured on President Donald Trump. Indeed, Harris\u2019s human life story stands in sharp political contrast to the severe anti-immigrant policies of Trump and his administration.\n\n\u201cOur family feels happy and I feel happy that my sister, Shyamala, her mother, would have been very happy and proud of her daughter,\u201d Harris\u2019s maternal uncle Gopalan Balachandran told media outlets in India on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic day in number of ways for the Indian community for the first time getting into a high political position,\u201d Balachandran said, according to the Reuters news agency.\n\nHarris was born in Oakland, California in 1964 to a British Jamaican-born father, Donald Harris, and an Indian mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris. She spent many of her formative years in nearby Berkeley.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Harris often speaks of the deep bond she shared with her mother, who she has called her single biggest influence.\n\n\u201cMy mother understood very well she as raising two Black daughters,\u201d Harris wrote in a 2018 autobiography.\n\n\u201cShe knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident Black women,\u201d she wrote. Their mother gave them Sanskrit names to carry their Indian identities.\n\nShyamala was born in 1938 in Chennai, formerly Madras in British India. She came to the US for graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where she met her future husband, a doctoral student in economics in the early 1960s.\n\nFor two freethinking young people drawn to activism, they landed on campus from opposite sides of the world just as US protests exploded around civil rights, the Vietnam War and voting rights. Their paths crossed in those movements, and they fell in love, according to an Associated Press 2019 candidate profile of Harris.\n\nAt the heart of Harris\u2019s parents\u2019 activism was a small group of students who met every Sunday to discuss the books of Black authors and grassroots activity around the world, from the anti-apartheid Black Consciousness Movement in South Africa to liberation movements in Latin America to the Black separatist preaching of Malcolm X in the US.\n\nHarris says her mother gave her an early grounding in the civil rights movement and instilled in her a duty not to complain but rather to act.\n\nHer mother died of cancer in 2009 at the age of 70.\n\nToday, the senator finds herself asking her mother, spiritually, for advice or remembering one of her oft-repeated lines. Her mother\u2019s amethyst ring sparkles from her hand. She still uses pots and wooden spoons that belonged to her mother and says she thinks of her when she is home and able to cook.\n\n\u201cShe [Kamala Harris] likes South Indian food because when I used to go to her [place], my sister used to cook and she used to eat all of that, so, she likes Indian food,\u201d said Balachandran, Harris\u2019s uncle.\n\n\u201cYeah, she is Indian, she likes India but that doesn\u2019t mean anything that India says is right for her, good for her. She is also Jamaican. She is Afro-American. So, she uses her own judgement \u2026 she likes India, she likes Indian music, but she likes jazz music also,\u201d he said.\n\nAlmost immediately after the announcement of Harris\u2019s candidacy, Trump attacked Harris by reverting to stereotypes, calling her \u201cextraordinarily nasty\u201d, \u201cmeanest\u201d, and \u201cmost horrible\u201d during a White House news conference on Tuesday.\n\nKaren Finney, a prominent Black strategist in the Democratic Party, pointed to immediate fundraising success as evidence that Biden\u2019s take on Harris is better than Trump\u2019s.\n\nThe Biden campaign hauled in almost $11m in the first four hours after Harris was announced as Biden\u2019s pick.\n\nThe Biden-Harris ticket \u201cmakes clear that Biden is serious about having people who like the diversity of our country and our future at the highest decision-making tables. That gives people hope,\u201d Finney told the Associated Press.\n\nHarris\u2019s father and her mother were separated when she was five years old. She writes of seeing him on weekends and over summers after he became a professor at Stanford University.\n\nIn a piece he wrote for the Jamaica Global website, Harris says he never gave up his love for his daughters, and the senator trumpeted her father as a superhero in her children\u2019s book.\n\nBut their relationship had been on and off over the years. In February, when Harris jokingly linked her use of marijuana to her Jamaican heritage, her father labelled the comment a \u201ctravesty\u201d and a shameful \u201cpursuit of identity politics\u201d."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk\/news\/national\/18645661.coronavirus-vaccine-candidate-induces-immune-response-trial-results-indicate\/","domain":"wiltshiretimes.co.uk","published_date":"2020-08-12

was generally well-tolerated, although some participants experienced mild to moderate side-effects.\n\nThese increased with dose level, in the seven days following vaccination, including pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, fever and sleep disturbance.\n\nAccording to an interim report of a phase 1\/2 clinical trial published in Nature, the vaccine, which is being developed by Pfizer, elicited a robust immune response in participants, which increased with dose level and with a second dose.\n\nAntibodies against Covid-19 were present 21 days after a single vaccination at all dose levels, and there was a substantial increase in Sars-CoV-2-neutralising antibodies seven days after the second dose was given.\n\nThe researchers wrote: \u201cThe clinical findings for the BNT162b1 RNA-based vaccine candidate are encouraging and strongly support accelerated clinical development, including efficacy testing, and at-risk manufacturing to maximise the opportunity for the rapid production of a Sars-CoV-2 vaccine to prevent Covid-19.\u201d\n\nCorresponding author Judith Absalon, senior medical director at Pfizer Vaccines Clinical Research, and colleagues reported interim data from an ongoing phase 1\/2 clinical study of BNT162b1.\n\nForty-five healthy adults \u2013 23 men and 22 non-pregnant women \u2013 aged 18 to 55 were randomised to receive 10 micrograms, 30 micrograms or 100 micrograms of BNT162b1, or a placebo.\n\nResearchers found the immune response was much stronger in the 30 microgram group than in the 10.\n\nHowever, there were no notable differences in immune response between the 30 and 100 groups after one dose, and, as participants who received the 100 microgram dose also experienced greater side-effects, they did not receive a second dose.\n\nAccording to the study, levels of neutralising antibodies in participants were 1.9 to 4.6 times higher than those in patients recovering from Sars-CoV-2 infection.\n\nBut the scientists warned that, although this comparison provides a benchmark for evaluating the vaccine-elicited immune response and the vaccine\u2019s potential to provide protection, phase 3 trials are needed to determine the efficacy of BNT162b1.\n\nThe study is also enrolling adults aged 65\u201385, and later phases will prioritise the enrolment of more-diverse populations.\n\nDelivered intramuscularly, BNT162b1, which encodes a Sars-CoV-2 receptor-binding antigen, is one of several RNA vaccine candidates that are being studied in parallel for selection to advance to a trial of their safety and efficacy.\n\nRNA vaccine platforms, which use messenger RNA to elicit an immune response, are generally considered safe and have facilitated the rapid development of vaccines against Sars-CoV-2.\n\nRNA is synthetic strands of genetic code, based on the virus\u2019s genetic material.\n\nOnce injected into muscle, the RNA self-amplifies \u2013 generating copies of itself.\n\nKathrin Jansen, senior vice president and head of vaccine research and development, Pfizer, said: \u201cThe publication of peer-reviewed data from our mRNA-based vaccine development programme against Sars-CoV-2 in a world-renowned publication like Nature provides further validation of our rapid progress toward developing a safe and effective potential vaccine to help address this current pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the overall advancement of the programme and look forward to generating additional data from our ongoing studies.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Pfizer and BioNTech recently

But Chinese buyers have started increasing purchases this year of a range of farm imports, sealing record deals in corn and meat imports, prompting some optimism among agriculture traders.\n\nSoya beans typically account for about half of China\u2019s US farm imports, and the vast bulk of buying comes in the last three months of the year when supplies from top grower Brazil dry up.\n\nAfter a slow start, Chinese importers booked more than $2.5bn in US soy purchases over the eight weeks to the end of July, a Reuters analysis of trade data showed."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/hawley-chinese-sanctions-hong-kong-wakeup-call","domain":"foxnews.com","published_date":"2020-08-12 22:43:04","title":"Hawley responds to Chinese sanction, says Hong Kong raid should serve as 'wakeup call' for the free world","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/a57.foxnews.com\/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net\/v1\/static\/694940094001\/cfa0b996-19cf-4706-9589-f00328ef12cc\/33284151-78a5-45e9-bd30-0575a5c63e18\/1280x720\/match\/896\/500\/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","content":"Sen.

In an interview with Fox News last year about the National Basketball Association (NBA) kowtowing to China, the former state attorney general accused Beijing of using high-pressure tactics to bend people to its will.\n\n\"This is how Beijing plays ball. They tighten the screws,\" he said at the time. \"Now they want to censor Americans. The thing about the NBA is, they're trying to tell Americans what we can and cannot say.

If you live on the west side of the storm, you didn\u2019t get much. If you live east of the storm, there\u2019s a lot of nasty weather there.\u201d\n\nIsaias caused destruction and two deaths as it uprooted trees, destroyed crops and homes and caused widespread flooding and small landslides in the Dominican Republic and the US territory of Puerto Rico.\n\nView image in fullscreen A man guides a tow truck under a downed power line pole after Tropical Storm Isaias affected the area in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico last week.

In Puerto Rico, the national guard rescued at least 35 people from floods that swept away one woman, whose body was recovered Saturday.\n\nIsaias then snapped trees and knocked out power as it blew through the Bahamas on Saturday. Officials in the Bahamas opened shelters for people in Abaco island to help those who have been living in temporary structures since Dorian devastated the area, killing at least 70 people in September 2019.\n\nAuthorities closed Florida beaches, parks and virus testing sites, lashing signs to palm trees to stop them blowing them away. Officials also adapted their shelter policies to the pandemic, providing spaces where people could stay safely apart from each other to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nIn Palm Beach county, about 150 people were in shelters, wearing masks, said emergency management spokeswoman Lisa De La Rionda.\n\nThe county has a voluntary evacuation order for those living in mobile or manufactured homes, or those who feel their home cannot withstand strong winds.\n\nIn Indian River county, north of West Palm Beach, Florida, emergency shelters were clearing out Sunday after Isaias was downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nOfficials told TCPalm newspapers that 38 people registered at three schools used as shelters. Those areas now must be cleaned to ensure no traces of the coronavirus remain as teachers and staff report Monday to prepare for the upcoming school year.\n\nNo one checked in with Covid-19 symptoms. Temperature checks were done at the door, officials said, and isolation rooms were designated in case anyone came in with symptoms."},{"topic":"WORLD","link":"https:\/\/indianexpress.com\/article\/india\/coronavirus-india-live-updates-covid-19-cases-tracker-latest-news-corona-cases-in-india-covid-19-vaccine-india-lockdown-today-news-6545324\/","domain":"indianexpress.com","published_date":"2020-08-10 03:41:24","title":"Coronavirus 09 august, HIGHLIGHTS: Indian Army gifts 10 ventilators to Nepali Army","lang":"en","large_image_url":"https:\/\/images.indianexpress.com\/2020\/08\/corona-delhi.jpg","content":"An artist gives final touches to wall graffiti in Kolkata honouring frontline Covid-19 warriors.
